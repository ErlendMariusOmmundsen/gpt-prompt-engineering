${Context_setter} *sep* ${example_pairs} *sep* The instruction was:,"[['Everyone needs a coach. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else\'s in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That\'s how we improve. Unfortunately, there\'s one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I\'m talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn\'t fair to them. It\'s not fair to students, and it\'s putting America\'s global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let\'s start by asking who\'s doing well. Well, unfortunately there\'s no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they\'re doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn\'t number one. We\'re not even in the top 10. We\'re tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we\'re 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there\'s really only one area where we\'re near the top, and that\'s in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let\'s look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai\'s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what\'s working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It\'s because there\'s so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today\'s average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we\'re asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let\'s talk about what\'s going on today. To get started, we\'re doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I\'ve talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can\'t really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It\'s not a perfect shot. It doesn\'t catch every little thing that\'s going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I\'m able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let\'s take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I\'m finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I\'ll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don\'t write things down, I don\'t remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I\'m seeing as I\'m writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I\'m glad that we\'ve actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn\'t. I think that video exposes so much of what\'s intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I\'ll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we\'d like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won\'t be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren\'t immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That\'s understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that\'s a big number, but to put it in perspective, it\'s less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that\'s fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn\'t just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I\'m excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you.

The summary of the input is:

This speech by Bill Gates focuses on the importance of feedback in the teaching profession. He notes that in the US, 98% of teachers receive no feedback, leading to low academic rankings, whereas places like Shanghai, China, which rank number one across the board, have a formal system for helping teachers improve. Gates argues that teachers need access to video, peer reviews, and student surveys in order to improve. This system would require a large investment, but would have an immense impact, giving all teachers the support they need and deserve.",stop,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'text-davinci-003', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 1, 'top_p': 1, 'max_tokens': 4096, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"
${Context_setter} *sep* ${example_pairs} *sep* The instruction was:,"[[""Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

Output: Conventional buildings are generally consumers of energy, built to be fast and cheap with high consumption of energy, reliance on fossil fuels, and high energy costs. By transforming these buildings into ""prosumers"" (producers + consumers), energy efficiency can be improved, electrification from fossil fuel can be shifted to decarbonised electricity (like solar and wind), and decarbonization can be achieved through efficient and low-carbon technologies (solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage).

${Context_setter} *sep* ${example_pairs} *sep* The instruction was:,"[['When I think about the rise of AI, I\'m reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What\'s the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI\'s need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn\'t enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let\'s take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what\'s trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can\'t a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector\'s drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they\'re making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they\'re using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they\'re easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it\'s only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we\'ll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What\'s the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI\'s need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn\'t enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let\'s take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what\'s trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can\'t a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector\'s drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they\'re making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they\'re using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they\'re easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it\'s only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we\'ll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

Covid-19, with many borders closed and the biggest economic crisis in a century, has of course a negative impact on globalisation.\nLooking at the trade-to-GDP ratio, the speed of globalisation was extremely fast between the early 1980s and 2008. Trade to GDP almost doubled.

However, I do not interpret this as systemic de-globalisation, but rather as a normalisation after the very rapid pace of integration previously.\nWhat is particularly striking is that the export-to-GDP ratio of China dropped the last 15 years significantly and this drop explains all of the slowdown in overall globalisation.\nChina today consumes more of what it produces and exports less, while its domestic supply chains are intensifying.\nIf there is one factor that could effectively slow down globalisation, it is rising inequality. In advanced economies, some of the rise in inequality comes from globalisation.\nThis often leads to backlashes against globalisation among the affected populations. As a result, we have seen policy decisions to reduce migration and to impose trade barriers.\nIn response, governments in advanced economies should provide a better safety nets to those who are negatively affected by globalisation.\nIn the future, I think globalisation will continue but at a slower pace. Globalisation will survive Covid-19. I do not expect a wave of “de-globalisation” overall as important parts of the world economy, e.g. India and Africa, with their positive demographics, have a huge potential to open up.\n\n\nA stronger international monetary system\n\nHowever, we should think how to support globalisation by improving the functioning of the international monetary system.\nThe US dollar has dominated the international monetary system since the end of World War II. That dominant role of the dollar has at times fuelled global imbalances, excess capital flows and volatility, liquidity shortages and exchange rate volatility, particularly in emerging economies.\nA multi-polar currency system would make the world economy less vulnerable to shocks linked to one specific currency.

It would have to be a market-driven process. But Europe and China can create the pre-conditions to make their currencies more attractive.\nIn Europe, we are doing that by deepening EMU further, through completing the banking union, creating a Capital Market Union (CMU), strengthening the financial infrastructure, reforming the ESM and creating more safe assets.\nIn China, Governor Zhou has worked for many years to open up the economy, including the capital account, strengthening and deepening further the domestic financial system while safeguarding fiscal and financial stability.\nThe results are promising!\n\n\nBuilding resilience against crises: regional crisis fighters\nLet me mention one other aspect of the international financial architecture: regional cooperation has been increasing.\nIn recent years, we have seen the creation of new multilateral development banks, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the New Development Bank, established by the BRICS countries.\nIn addition, we have seen the emergence of new Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs), in particular in Europe and Asia.

${Context_setter} *sep* ${example_pairs} *sep* The instruction was:,"[[""Hello everyone. I'm both delighted and proud to be speaking here today.\nDelighted, because it's fantastic to see such enthusiasm for events like this and that you've all taken time out of your busy schedules to focus on and think about how as women, you navigate your future and the future of others, as leaders in the public sector. \nAnd I'm proud to have been asked to speak because the invitation signals (to me at least!), that perceptions of the Treasury as a haven for men in suits with beige mind sets, has seen a fundamental shift, one that I ascribe directly to our commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion.\nToday I'm going to cover 3 things. First, why diversity and inclusion matters. Second, what the Treasury is doing about it. And third, what we can all do about it. \n\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nLet's start. Why does it matter? Why should we care about diversity and inclusion? I used to think that there was such an obvious answer to that that I ignored the question. I was wrong. I've discovered that there are many people who don't believe it matters at all. So we do need to address it.\nBut let's start with the economy. It's in a relatively strong position. We have good levels of growth, price stability, job creation, low unemployment and high labour participation rates.\nOur public finances are in good shape; the Crown's books have returned to surplus and debt is under control.\nFor the first time in our history, we're part of the fastest growing region in the world, demand for our products and services is strong and technology is reducing our distance from markets. We're one of the most diverse nations on earth; there are over 200 ethnicities in Auckland, making it one of the most diverse cities on earth. The World Bank rates us as the best place in the world to do business, our public sector is ranked number one as the least corrupt on the planet according to Transparency international. And the Legatum\nInstitute has New Zealand ranked first on its Prosperity Index.\nIt sounds good, and compared to many other countries across the world it is very good.\nBut of course it reflects the present rather than the future. And what we can see ahead of us are challenges that we need to manage and opportunities that we need to seize. That's about improving our productivity, looking for value for money in government spending, focusing on citizens, continuing to strengthen our resilience, deepening our international connections and ensuring people have the capabilities and opportunities to live the lives they value.\nAnd that's a key part of this: people and their capabilities and opportunities. It's people who make an economy, who create and run its institutions, who innovate and run its businesses, who create its jobs, who pay its taxes, who build its houses and who set its rules.\nAnd half the people in the country are women. Our labour force participation rate for women is currently at 65.3 percent, up from 56.6 percent just twenty years ago; men's participation rate is largely unchanged over the last twenty years, increasing from 74.9 percent to 76 percent. The female unemployment rate is higher than that of men, 5.7 percent compared with 4.8 percent for men.\nWomen are gaining qualifications at a greater rate than men but their skills are not being translated into greater career opportunities and development in the workplace. Currently many women are educated and trained in areas that do not match where employment is growing. We know for example that STEM industries are in a growth phase yet women make up just 14 percent of the of this sector. Despite an increase in qualifications, women are over-represented in minimum wage jobs. More women than men are currently not in education, employment or training (NEET).\nAs we look ahead, we know that technology and population ageing will have significant impacts on the shape of the jobs market and the shape of our labour force. These are challenges but they also offer opportunities and, I would argue, for women in particular.\n\n\nThe Treasury\n\nLet's look at the Treasury. Why do I think that diversity and inclusion matter? Why is there a statement on every floor of our building which says that “we embrace diversity and inclusion as they strengthen us, as individuals and as an organisation”? Again you may think the answer is obvious but it's important to be clear.\nWe are the Government's lead economic and financial adviser. We want to be a worldleading Treasury because we're ambitious for ourselves and for New Zealand. We see our mission as improving New Zealanders' living standards. Living standards depend on economic growth and productivity performance but it's not the whole story. They also depend on things like the quality of our environment, the trust people have in our institutions, and people having the opportunities and skills to live the life they want to lead.\nAt the heart of the Treasury's role, at the core of what people expect of us, is the skill of analysis and the exploration of options, the understanding of trade-offs and the presentation of advice to enable choices to be made.\nDoing our job well requires knowledge, analytical skills, an understanding of context, and the ability to explain clearly. It depends on the minds – and the hearts – of the people that make up our organisation. And that's why I believe that to become a world-leading organisation, our advice and services need to be informed by a range of perspectives to enable the fresh thinking and ideas needed to manage the challenges and opportunities facing New Zealand. So I put a premium on diversity of thought.\nBeing a diverse and inclusive organisation makes us stronger, more resilient and insightful. It helps us to understand the present, better anticipate the challenges and opportunities that may arise in the future and better manage the pace, complexity and crosscutting nature of change. Inclusive diversity in all its forms – ethnic, gender, whatever – is at the core of our continued success as an organisation.\n\n\nWhat we're doing about it\n\nSo what are we doing about it?\nWe've benefited from the development of our Living Standards Framework. It wasn't designed as a diversity and inclusion tool but it's become a diversity and inclusion enabler. The LSF is a tool that helps to shape and inform our advice to Ministers to promote an economic system that improves the intergenerational wellbeing of New Zealanders. It enables us to think about the aims of our policy objectives – such as improved economic growth – while taking account of the wider impacts that a policy option may have on other factors such as resilience, social cohesion, sustainability and equity. It helps develop policies that increase the opportunities, capabilities and incentives for people to participate productively in economic life.\nMore specifically on diversity and inclusion itself, you could say the Treasury has been on a journey. A few years ago we had the simple idea to ask our staff how included they felt, what diversity meant to them, how they thought we could become more diverse and what we could start doing to embed a culture of diversity and inclusion at the Treasury. Today, diversity and inclusion is at the heart of our organisational strategy and a defining ambition for me.\nI want to mention 5 things that I think have been important to that journey.\nWe started off by focusing on gender diversity and doing things that now seem dated but were actually quite challenging for the organisation.\nFor example, we made a big push to facilitate part-time manager roles, to support flexible working and parental leave. I am sure we can do better in the way we design jobs and\ntasks. In fact I think employers in general can do a better job in designing jobs and tasks; it's probably the key to addressing barriers to women in the labour force. For my part, one of the things I'm keen to see is greater job-sharing. It's hard to organise but it is a way of addressing some of the challenges of part-time working.\nA few years ago my executive leadership team decided to address the issue of unconscious bias which is the subtle foe of diversity and inclusion. Without being aware, we can unconsciously exclude people that are different or seen as ‘outsiders' who don't ‘fit the mould'. That means excluding different ideas, different perspectives and better understanding and promoting group think. So ELT undertook unconscious bias training, as did our managers and, inevitably, we realised we all had our fair share of biases, conscious and unconscious.\nFor example, my past – the places I grew up in, the schools I went to, the organisations I've worked in, the people I've spent time with – makes me a particular type. You can't undo that but you can recognise and address it.\nOne of the things we've done to address unconscious bias is through the use of blind applications in our recruitment practices. We've reformed our graduate recruitment process to reduce unconscious bias and to expand the skills, experiences and qualifications that we value. In particular we broadened our reach through school visits and engaging cultural groups on campuses. And we introduced blind applications which redact personal information such as name, gender, location and school attended, to reduce unconscious bias within the selection process.\nThese changes are leading to change. In 2007, our graduate intake was evenly split on\ngender, but 100% identified as NZ European. The 2017 graduate cohort still has a 50/50 gender representation but it's more diverse, with a little over one third identifying as being solely NZ European and the balance a mix or other ethnicities. This greater diversity of talent – the leaders of the future – will strengthen us. It makes sense to have the Treasury made up of people that not only have the intellectual horse-power to dig deep into complex issues but also have the ability to see, understand and solve them from a range of perspectives.\nWe're also looking hard to ensure that we don't just stop at ‘diversity'. ‘Inclusion' is the Siamese twin that translates diversity of thought and experience into insights which can be applied to our work.\nMeasuring inclusion is harder. Ultimately it'll be reflected in the strength of our advice. But we're looking to make sure our practices are inclusive and we're using surveys to assess how well we're doing. At the moment, the results are positive: three quarters of Treasury people spoken to recently said that the Treasury was ‘invested' (or more) in diversity and inclusion compared to a similar number saying we were just ‘interested' in it a couple of years ago. But we're far from finished. Ultimately, I want diversity and inclusion to be ‘embedded'. We regularly commission such assessments to understand the progress we're making and to hold ourselves to account.\nWe also regularly track and report on the diversity of our workforce and our leadership team. It's essential if you want to understand where you are and where you want to get to. We're aiming to maintain at least a 40-60 percent gender balance in our leadership cohort, and to keep within a 45-55 percent range across the organisation as a whole. At the last count, the Treasury's people were 47 percent female and 53 percent male; the gender balance of people leader roles was 35.6 percent female and 64.4 percent male.\nUnlike gender, our ethnic diversity is less representative of the population as a whole. 7.3 percent of our staff identify as Māori which compares to the 14 percent of people in the country who do so. 1.6 percent of our staff identify as Pasifika and 6.8 percent as Asian. We're aiming for our ethnicity representation to be within plus or minus 5 percentage points of the national working age population.\nWe've got gender and ethnic pay gaps and, like every other agency, we're also looking at how we can reduce them. Our gender pay gap has fallen over the last 10 years but rose again between 2015 and 2016. At 22.9 percent, it's a gap that I'm concerned about. We're looking to understand what's driving it. One explanation for the recent change is that wehaven't replaced the talented women in management roles who have left for bigger jobs with other talented women. Our pipeline isn't flowing consistently enough and we need to work out how to fix that. And as for our ethnic pay gap, well I can't tell you what that is as we don't know, not reliably anyway. In fact many agencies couldn't tell you what their ethnic pay gap is. It's because we are limited by the data we collect. We need to do better. \nOverall, this is about ensuring that the Treasury is attracting and growing the diversity of people and thinking needed to do the job we want to do.\n\n\nWhat we can all do about it\n\nFinally, having told you what the Treasury's trying to do about diversity and inclusion, I want  to touch on what all of us can do about it.\nFor those of us in leadership roles, I have 5 suggestions: (1) make sure you understand  your organisation, its strategic context and its desired ‘diversity' profile; (2) question the  processes and practices within your own organisations. Look with fresh eyes at the systems  you work with and ask whether you are excluding people and ideas. Do some unconscious  bias training; (3) make sure you understand and communicate the business case for  achieving your organisation's desired ‘diversity profile'. Once you've communicated it, do  it again and again and again; (4) look to guide, mentor and support your colleagues. It will  pay off for you, for the women in your organisation, and for your organisation; and (5) talk  to people outside of your organisation about what you're doing and why. We need everyone  to understand the importance of diversity and inclusion and the opportunities it offers us.  So tell your stakeholders, your friends and your family. \nFor those of you not in leadership roles, do the same thing. This has to be a shared  endeavour. Make sure you understand and can communicate the business case for  diversity and inclusion. Bring your ideas to the table, share your experiences, and hold your  leaders to account for growing diversity and inclusion in your organisations.  And for all of you: support, and learn from, each other.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOne thing that I have emphasised is making the business case for diversity and inclusion. I've deliberately not talked about it being ‘the right thing to do'. While in fact I think that this is the right thing to do, and it may be what some of you think, there are people out there with different values to ours. \nThey may disagree with the statement ‘diversity strengthens us' and some may be shocked at what I've said today. In the spirit of diversity and inclusion, we need to be aware of these different values and persuade them of the business case. In my view, we can persuade them that greater diversity and inclusion does matter, that it would make a positive difference to them. And I suggest that we can't simply argue that our values are better than theirs or assume our own values make a business case. \nThe good thing is we don't need to rest on that. The business case, the evidence, is there. We need to articulate it well and hold our leaders to account for delivering it.\nOrganisations that reflect the societies they serve are stronger and more successful than those that don't. New Zealand's diversity is an asset. I firmly believe that when we work, think, and act to leverage that asset, we're seizing one of the greatest opportunities of our age.\nBe it gender diversity or ethnic diversity, both create diversity of thought. It is diversity that will help us manage the rapidly-changing world around us. But saying it is easier than doing it. It requires leadership, from every one of us. It requires us to inspire, to influence, to challenge, to have the will and to be determined.""], ['Why does Diversity & Inclusion matter?\nWomen gain qualifications faster than men.\nWomen educated in areas not in high demand.\nWomen hold most minimum-wage jobs\nWhy is it important in the Treasury?\nTreasury analyzes and advises for choices.\nPromote fresh thinking & ideas for challenges.\nIt builds strength & resilience\nWhat we are doing/did about it\nSupport flexible working & parental leave.\nUse blind applications in our recruitment practices.\nReducing gender & ethic pay gap']]",1,,"

Rapidly accelerated digital transformations, opportunistic phishing campaigns, discontinuity of information security operations and fnancial constraints are creating the perfect storm in a COVID-19-disrupted world. CISOs who understand these challenges and can pivot their security approach can help their organizations to emerge stronger.\n\nAccenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (Accenture CTI) has been creating relevant, timely and actionable threat intelligence for more than 20 years. Now, following the acquisitions of Context in March 2020 and Seattle-based Security of Things company, Deja vu Security in June 2019, Accenture Security has gained an additional 20 years' intelligence reporting and deep expertise in the techniques, tools and methods for securing connected devices and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The cyber threat intelligence team, referred to in this report as Accenture CTI, provides IT security and business operations with actionable and relevant decision support\n\nSince our last report in 2019, our cyber threat intelligence and incident response teams have investigated numerous cases of suspected cyber espionage and fnancially-motivated targeting. During these investigations, threat intelligence analysts and incident responders have gained frst-hand visibility of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed by some of the most sophisticated cyber adversaries/\n\nOur track record of experience serves us well as we unravel the changes in cybersecurity threats in the last 12 months. Early in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most businesses across the globe found they needed to shift quickly to remote work—some did so according to a plan, others reacted but not according to their plan, and still more did not even have a plan. Remote work has challenged enterprise security monitoring in numerous ways from the platforms used for communication to the devices people are using and networks on which they transmit data. We have seen an increase in social engineering opportunities as cyberespionage and cybercriminal groups attempt to take advantage of vulnerable employees unfamiliar with managing their technology environments. The worldwide, economic and business disruptions have put tremendous fnancial challenges on businesses. Those pressures inevitably fow down to information security operations to maintain or increase coverage under ever-tighter budgetary constraints.\n\nSophisticated threat actors are employing new TTPs to help achieve their long-standing objectives of regime survival, economic acceleration, military superiority, information operations and cyber espionage. As we detail later in this report, our threat intelligence analysts have seen adversaries develop new implants for use against Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange environments, and more sophisticated command and control methods that attempt to disrupt detection efforts through internal proxy mechanisms.\n\nCriminals will still work to monetize access to data or networks, perhaps more frequently than before as the economy continues to be vulnerable. As we have seen this year, supply chain compromise and off-the-shelf tools could feature heavily, as could ongoing evidence of custom tools designed to evade defenses\n\nRansomware has increased in popularity among bad actors, as data theft increases the pressures on victims. With game-changing ransomware attacks, such as the Maze threat, the name-and-shame technique has gained momentum that calls into question the cost versus disruption debate\n\nIn such a climate, and with organizations attempting to stabilize their current operations, CISOs should put the right controls in place to create a safe and secure environment. Accenture has identified four elements of adaptive security that can help: a secure mindset, secure network access, secure work environments and secure collaboration. CISOs should engage with business leaders to plan, prepare and practice for greater cybersecurity resilience, backed by the right resources and investments. Accenture believes a multi-dimensional crisis management strategy, with many work streams and teams that collaborate closely, often on a daily basis, is the way to help achieve cybersecurity resilience—and can help to protect enterprises from harm.\n\nRead on to take a deeper dive into the fve frontline trends identifed in 2020. These insights can enhance the work of security teams and put security technology investments, security processes and the business strategy on a frm footing to help achieve the desired level of cyber resilience""], ['Cybersecurity & COVID-19\n- Remote work has challenged enterprise security\n- There is an increase in cyberesponiage episodes\n- We need more security within ever-tighter budgets\nDevelopments in the Cyber Threatscape\n- Increased monetization of access to data\n- More sophisticated in disrupting detection efforts\n- Increased ransomware attacks\nAdopting Adaptive Security\n- Plan & prepare for cybersecurity resilience\n- Have a multi-faceted crisis management strategy\n- Collaborate closely across work streams/teams']]",1,,,stop,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'text-davinci-003', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 1, 'top_p': 1, 'max_tokens': 4096, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"
${Context_setter} *sep* ${example_pairs} *sep* The instruction was:,"[[""The foundation is what we call the organisation principles. Who are you? If you had to describe\nyourself as a person, you'd say, “I'm dynamic”, “I love spending time with people”, “I value\nrelationships”, etc. What are the same set of statements for you as a company? Do you guys have a\nwritten down, well-articulated simple way of describing what you stand for as a company and why you\nexist? That's what the organisation principles are. The foundation is basically, Who am I? Why do I\nexist? Not just a series of statements, but something written down. You can call it a company constitution,\nor a company manifesto, but you have it written down in a way that everyone understands. So that's\nthe foundation. If the new team member who joined you last month doesn't know what this means, then\nyou're already in trouble.\n\nThen, there are three pillars. The first one is basically how you work - what is your way of working as a\ncompany? The second pillar is your HR policies and practices - how do you deal with people, and how\ndo you deal with each other? And the third is the people component itself - how inspirational are you\nas a leader? How inspirational are your managers, and how well are your teams working together?\nWhat's the effectiveness of how teams work together? These are the three pillars that support the\noverall culture.\n\nThere are several components to how you work: decision making and alignment tend to be big topics,\nparticularly as you scale. As a small team, when you make decisions, you can announce it in your\nweekly all-hands and everyone gets it very quickly, and moves on. As you start getting a bit bigger,\npeople start wondering, “Why did you take that decision?”, “No one explained it to me. I'm lost and\nconfused.” That happens very, very frequently. And Alignment is not just about taking decisions, but\nrather hearing everyone's points of view, and whether everyone truly believes in where you're going.\nThese are some of the elements that add up to the way of working for you as a company. What you\nhave to think about is whether we have each of these operational practices working well for us:\nalignment, decision-making, collaboration, communication, impact, and innovation.\n\nIn earlier-stage companies fewer than 100 people, career development is a non-issue. No one seems to\ncare, they are just so busy having impact, and having fun. But the moment you cross 100-150 people,\nthey start showing up on the radar all over the place. “Where am I going?”, “What's my next\npromotion?”, “What's going to happen to me?” - all that starts becoming important. Hiring which is\nreally having a solid way to make sure you hire people that fit well with your company. Policies,\nparticularly things like reward , ESOPs, whether people understand what you're doing and why. A lot\nof startups have very confused communication around basic health insurance, ESOP, rewards, and that\nstarts to matter. And the one that irritates most people from the early stage to late stage, and never\nseems to go away, is your performance management system. How will people be assessed in a fair\nmanner? How will you get feedback and how will people progress through their careers? This is\nsomething that is broken almost for all companies in the startup ecosystem, and what we need to worry\nabout. This is what adds up to HR policies and practices.\n\nThe final piece is around inspirational leadership. For many of you, a lot of this will be about you,\nyourself, and what is your own personal manager NPS, and as you get a bit bigger, how inspirational\nand effective your managers are.\n\nThese are the three pillars, and all of this - the foundation plus three pillars - is what adds up to that\noverall NPS score you have as a company""], [""How you work\n- Good communication & collaboration practices \n- How decision-making scales with your company\n- Alignment & hearing everyone's POV\nHR policies & practices\n- Hire people that fit well with your company\n- Fair assessment of performance & rewards\n- Transparency in career development\nPeople & inspirational leadership\n- A lot of it is about YOU yourself\n- How inspirational are your managers?\n- What is your own personal manager NPS?""]]",1,," Explain what the three pillars of organizational culture are, and explain the components of each of them.

Output:
Globalisation is a cyclical process that is affected by a variety of factors, such as economic crises, inequality, and pandemics. To protect the global economy, a multi-polar currency system is needed. To make globalisation equitable and effective, policymakers need to actively develop and promote regional cooperation and integration.

Diversity and inclusion are important in the Treasury department, as it promotes fresh thinking and ideas to tackle challenges. To enhance the representation of female employees, businesses should support flexible working and parental leave, use blind applications in recruitment, and work to reduce the gender and ethnic pay gap.

Cybersecurity is more important than ever due to the increase of remote work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the threatscape evolves with increased monetization of access to data, ransomware attacks, and more sophisticated attempts at disrupting detection efforts, businesses need to plan and prepare for cybersecurity resilience, forming a multi-faceted crisis management strategy and collaborating closely across work streams and teams.",stop,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'text-davinci-003', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 1, 'top_p': 1, 'max_tokens': 4096, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

Output:Globalisation is a process in which countries come together to increase international trade, leading to exchanges of technology, knowledge, and culture. It has been growing at an unprecedented rate, but faced a slowdown due to the global financial crisis in 2008 and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unequal distribution of resources in countries and rising inequality in global markets can lead to backlashes against globalisation, pushing for policies within regions and countries to promote fairness. In order to move forward, the world needs to move towards a multi-polar currency system, decentralised renewable energy generation, and optimised, automated electricity grids.

Diversity and inclusion matter in all aspects of business and life, promoting fresh ideas and preventing biases. Women, in particular, often hold degrees that have little relevance to the current labour market and end up in underemployment and holding minimum-wage jobs. To overcome this, businesses are actively working towards measures such as flexible working, parental leave, blind recruitment practices, and reducing gender and ethnic pay gaps.

The digital transformation brought by the pandemic has made cybersecurity a priority. Remote working has created new security challenges and an increased need for budget-friendly security solutions. Attacks are becoming more sophisticated and ransomware is a growing threat. To improve cybersecurity, a crisis management strategy and close collaboration between teams is important.

Mentorship is an invaluable tool for personal and professional development and can take many forms. A mentor should have diverse experience, be empathetic and curious, and a good listener. Mentees should be prepared, engage in regular follow-ups, and research suitable mentors.

Output:Globalisation has been heavily affected by a number of factors, including economic crises, rising inequality, and the global pandemic. The 2008 financial crisis caused a reversal of the trend of high-speed globalisation, and the recent pandemic crisis has contributed to the slowing of the pace of globalisation. To ensure an equitable process of globalisation, policymakers must actively strive to develop and deepen regional cooperation and integration through multilateralism. Additionally, greater attention must be paid to the importance of diversity and inclusion. Women often gain qualifications more quickly than men, yet hold most minimum-wage jobs, leading to a gender pay gap. To combat this, many organisations are using blind application processes and offering more flexible movements within their workplaces. Finally, the coronavirus has highlighted the need to take cyber security more seriously. With remote work on the rise, enterprise security is being challenged. To offset this, adaptive security must be employed, with multi-faceted crisis management plans being developed.",stop,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'text-davinci-003', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 1, 'top_p': 1, 'max_tokens': 4096, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

Output:Globalisation moves in cycles
Globalisation is not a linear process; it often moves in waves, with cycles of commodification being followed by de-globalisation and then re-globalisation. Globalisation can be seen as a response to economic forces - for example, following the financial crisis of 2008, there was a dip in the speed of globalisation as the world entered a period of de-globalisation. Unequal distribution of resources and benefits of globalisation can also elicit a backlash against the process, leading to regional de-globalisation.

The Importance of Multilateralism in a Crisis
The pandemic crisis has highlighted the importance of multilateralism in addressing a shared global challenge. To maintain and strengthen the process of globalisation, policymakers should strive to develop initiatives that underpin regional cooperation and integration. Multilateral cooperation enables a more equitable and global approach in sharing the costs and opportunities of globalisation and is key in maintaining integration and development in the face of such crises.",stop,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'text-davinci-003', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 1, 'top_p': 1, 'max_tokens': 4096, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

Answer:
Why does Diversity & Inclusion matter?
It is important for Diversity & Inclusion to matter in order to create an equitable and diverse workplace, where people of all genders, races, ethnicities, and backgrounds are given the opportunity to rise to the top in their respective fields. Diversity & Inclusion also helps create a workforce that is better prepared to solve complex problems and come up with fresh ideas and solutions.

What we are doing/did about it
To support Diversity & Inclusion within the Treasury, we have implemented several initiatives such as offering flexible working arrangements and parental leave, using blind applications in recruitment practices, and reducing the gender and ethnic pay gap.

Please explain the following texts in the form of an output. 

Output: Why does Diversity & Inclusion matter? 
Diversity & Inclusion matter because it provides equal rights and opportunities to all individuals regardless of their gender or ethnicity. This ensures individuals can reach their full potential, which in turn benefits the organization. In the Treasury, diversity and inclusion is important as it promotes fresh thinking and ideas to help address the challenges that the organization faces. To address this, the Treasury can support flexible working and parental leave, and reduce the gender and ethnic pay gap through the use of blind application. 

Output:Cybersecurity & COVID-19
COVID-19 has highlighted the need for increased cybersecurity measures. Remote work has challenged enterprise security and there has been an increase in cyber espionage episodes which emphasizes the importance of better security, even with ever-tighter budgets. Developments in the cyber threatscape have seen an increased monetization of access to data and more sophisticated techniques have been developed to disrupt detection efforts, as well as an increase in ransomware attacks.
