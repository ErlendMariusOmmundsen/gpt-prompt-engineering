${Context_setter} *sep* ${example_pairs} *sep* The instruction was:,"[[""The foundation is what we call the organisation principles. Who are you? If you had to describe\nyourself as a person, you'd say, “I’m dynamic”, “I love spending time with people”, “I value\nrelationships”, etc. What are the same set of statements for you as a company? Do you guys have a\nwritten down, well-articulated simple way of describing what you stand for as a company and why you\nexist? That's what the organisation principles are. The foundation is basically, Who am I? Why do I\nexist? Not just a series of statements, but something written down. You can call it a company constitution,\nor a company manifesto, but you have it written down in a way that everyone understands. So that's\nthe foundation. If the new team member who joined you last month doesn't know what this means, then\nyou're already in trouble.\n\nThen, there are three pillars. The first one is basically how you work - what is your way of working as a\ncompany? The second pillar is your HR policies and practices - how do you deal with people, and how\ndo you deal with each other? And the third is the people component itself - how inspirational are you\nas a leader? How inspirational are your managers, and how well are your teams working together?\nWhat's the effectiveness of how teams work together? These are the three pillars that support the\noverall culture.\n\nThere are several components to how you work: decision making and alignment tend to be big topics,\nparticularly as you scale. As a small team, when you make decisions, you can announce it in your\nweekly all-hands and everyone gets it very quickly, and moves on. As you start getting a bit bigger,\npeople start wondering, “Why did you take that decision?”, “No one explained it to me. I'm lost and\nconfused.” That happens very, very frequently. And Alignment is not just about taking decisions, but\nrather hearing everyone’s points of view, and whether everyone truly believes in where you’re going.\nThese are some of the elements that add up to the way of working for you as a company. What you\nhave to think about is whether we have each of these operational practices working well for us:\nalignment, decision-making, collaboration, communication, impact, and innovation.\n\nIn earlier-stage companies fewer than 100 people, career development is a non-issue. No one seems to\ncare, they are just so busy having impact, and having fun. But the moment you cross 100-150 people,\nthey start showing up on the radar all over the place. “Where am I going?”, “What's my next\npromotion?”, “What's going to happen to me?” - all that starts becoming important. Hiring which is\nreally having a solid way to make sure you hire people that fit well with your company. Policies,\nparticularly things like reward , ESOPs, whether people understand what you're doing and why. A lot\nof startups have very confused communication around basic health insurance, ESOP, rewards, and that\nstarts to matter. And the one that irritates most people from the early stage to late stage, and never\nseems to go away, is your performance management system. How will people be assessed in a fair\nmanner? How will you get feedback and how will people progress through their careers? This is\nsomething that is broken almost for all companies in the startup ecosystem, and what we need to worry\nabout. This is what adds up to HR policies and practices.\n\nThe final piece is around inspirational leadership. For many of you, a lot of this will be about you,\nyourself, and what is your own personal manager NPS, and as you get a bit bigger, how inspirational\nand effective your managers are.\n\nThese are the three pillars, and all of this - the foundation plus three pillars - is what adds up to that\noverall NPS score you have as a company""], ['How you work\nGood communication & collaboration practices \nHow decision-making scales with your company\nAlignment & hearing everyone’s POV\nHR policies & practices\nHire people that fit well with your company\nFair assessment of performance & rewards\nTransparency in career development\nPeople & inspirational leadership\nA lot of it is about YOU yourself\nHow inspirational are your managers?\nWhat is your own personal manager NPS?']]",2,," to explain the company's foundation and three pillars that support the overall culture.
