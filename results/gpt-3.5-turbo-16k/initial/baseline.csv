 ${text}",[[]],0,"When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much. (Applause)

(Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)",Teachers need real feedback,"user:

To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)",Teachers need real feedback,"user:

Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)",AI isn't as smart as you think -- but it could be,"user:

That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)

And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)",AI isn't as smart as you think -- but it could be,"user:
suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes.

Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in?

The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing.

So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did.

I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away.

They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ...

It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does. AJ: And I love you. Thank you so much for letting me be of service. Bless you. (Applause)",How online abuse of women has spiraled out of control,"user:

I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does.

And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ...

And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:

And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:
suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
How many of us have ever seen something, thought that we should report it, but decided not to? And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)",Our dangerous obsession with perfectionism is getting worse,"user:

John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down.

Perfectionism is often seen as a desirable trait, but it can lead to feelings of discontent and dissatisfaction
Perfectionism is associated with a range of psychological difficulties, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders
Perfectionism has been on the rise in recent years, coinciding with an increase in mental illness among young people
The Influence of Society on Perfectionism
Society's emphasis on material wealth and status contributes to the pursuit of a perfect life and lifestyle
Social media platforms amplify the importance of appearance and perfection, creating a culture where the appearance of perfection is more important than reality
The idea of the American dream and the belief that hard work always pays off perpetuates the notion of perfectionism and personal value tied to wealth and status
The Alarming Rise of Socially Prescribed Perfectionism
Socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that others expect perfection, has seen the largest increase among the three elements of perfectionism
Socially prescribed perfectionism is strongly correlated with serious mental illness
Projections indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism by 2050",stop,"[0.32224664092063904, 0.15972012281417847, 0.21030926704406738, 0.1321229189634323]","[0.3764705882352941, 0.28108108108108104, 0.3280423280423281, 0.18823529411764706]","[0.08333333333333333, 0.04371584699453552, 0.0748663101604278, 0.04761904761904762]","[0.27058823529411763, 0.20540540540540544, 0.1798941798941799, 0.17647058823529413]",0,1.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,1,3,9,2.9,4.75,4.5,4.35,"{'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 0.3, 'top_p': 1, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Please, stand up. If you're able. Thank you. I want you to feel like I felt, when I was getting sentenced. It's August 17, 2012. I’m handcuffed and standing for four long hours while the judge is reading my sentence. You're in a small cage and you're surrounded by 10 prison guards in balaclavas. There is also a guard dog who is barking at you angrily because the dog is trained to be suspicious towards people who smell like prison. Even a nice little doge is angry at me. I'm stripped down from my humanity. I'm reduced to being just a prisoner. I'm 22 and I smell like prison. The prosecutor asked for three years in jail for me. My crime is considered to be severe, and it means that the judge can give me up to seven years in jail. And as I'm standing here handcuffed behind the bars, I’m thinking to myself: Can one person change the world? Is it even worth trying? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Will I be able to achieve my dreams or I'm going to be inevitably smashed by the system? I ran away from home when I was 16 years old. I jumped on a plane, went from Siberia to Moscow. I was 16 and I was a dreamer. And I knew that I want two things in life. I want to be able to dream wildly and to be able to make my utopian dreams come true. For that, I knew I needed to be in Moscow. I was studying philosophy and I was stealing food and clothes in order to survive. When I turned 22, I got arrested for resisting to one of the most dangerous dictators on planet Earth. At the day of my arrest, my daughter turned four. You can sit down if you want. What is my crime exactly? I sang a song. ""Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin."" Me and four other members of Pussy Riot came to Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and we preached to the people of Russia from the holy place that for thousands of years was reserved only for the male preachers and, in particular, for the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, who today sends Russians to kill and to die in Ukraine. We sang our song on February 21 of 2012. We did it in response to Putin's announcement that he wants to rule Russia pretty much indefinitely. I dropped everything I was doing, and I promised to myself that I'm going to dedicate my life to resistance. I felt deep inside me that Putin equals death, medieval torture, knife in the back, stagnation, new Dark Ages for Russia. To resist, we used our loud voices, bright ski masks, dresses, courage, commitment and performance art. We would show up in public places, unannounced, guerrilla style. No permits at all. And perform, preach. We performed in government buildings, squares, shopping malls, and we would get arrested almost every single day, get out and go back to action. Our job was to show the people of Russia that resisting is indeed an option. The supreme, sacred, holy rule in Putin's Russia is to remain afraid. We decided to break this rule. By breaking this rule, we disrupted the game as such. We exposed it as a mere game. We said that the emperor is naked. Did we achieve what we wanted? As I'm standing behind the bars, handcuffed, I'm asking myself this question. Yes and no. As I said in my closing statement, we are behind the prison bars, but we are freer than people who are prosecuting us because we can say whatever we want to say and they can say only things that the government censorship allows them to say. Despite of the global movement in support of Pussy Riot, we got convicted to two years in jail. The hell was in front of me. I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona. It's unique in Russia, free of censorship, [an] independent media outlet. In 2022, we raised seven million dollars in two days for Ukraine. When reproductive rights became under attack in the United States, we raised close to one million dollars for Planned Parenthood. We started Unicorn DAO and raised two million dollars to collect art made by women and non-binary people. I really wish I could tell all of this to a 22-year-old version of myself that is standing behind the bars, separated from her family, not knowing what's going to happen next. Much work remains to be done. My friends and family are getting beaten, imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and murdered back home. In March 2023, I was put on Russia's most-wanted list. I'm facing new criminal charges for the art I made. Why? Because I said that the emperor is naked and because he is, in fact, naked, he's scared of it. We shattered the world of appearances and we said that living a lie is indeed living a lie. And it's dangerous for any dictatorship. The reason why I became a threat to the system, not because of any actual physical power that I have, but because courage is contagious. And any act of speaking the truth can cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness. And we all have this power. It's a moral act to use this power. You may or may not achieve the results that you wanted, but there is eternal beauty in trying to find truth, in risking everything you've got for what's right, stop calculating your profit and just taking a leap of faith. Courage is an ability to act in the face of fear. And some of us have chosen to live courageously. For some of us, it's not a choice. It's a matter of survival, like for our Ukrainian friends. Vladimir Putin became intimidated by Ukraine choosing the path of freedom and democracy. That's why the Russian army bombs maternity wards, schools, hospitals, rapes and kills civilians and throws their bodies in mass graves. Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side. The world is with the brave people of Ukraine. And in your final hour, when you pray to whoever you're going to be praying to, know that she is on our side. She's on the side of truth. (Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime. He said in his closing statement, ""I know that the day will come when the darkness engulfing our country will dissipate. This day will come as inevitably as spring comes to replace even the frostiest winter."" And I'll finish my speech with words of ... 22-year-old version of myself. I said in my closing statement, ""Passion, openness and naivete are superior to hypocrisy, cunning and contrived decency that conceals crimes.

Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side. The world is with the brave people of Ukraine. And in your final hour, when you pray to whoever you're going to be praying to, know that she is on our side. She's on the side of truth. (Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime. He said in his closing statement, ""I know that the day will come when the darkness engulfing our country will dissipate. This day will come as inevitably as spring comes to replace even the frostiest winter."" And I'll finish my speech with words of ... 22-year-old version of myself. I said in my closing statement, ""Passion, openness and naivete are superior to hypocrisy, cunning and contrived decency that conceals crimes. (In Russian) Open all doors, take off the epaulettes, feel the smell of freedom with us.” Thank you. (Applause and cheers)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)",Shape-shifting tech will change work as we know it,"user:

And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

","The Evolution of Tools and Interfaces
Tools have evolved to become more specialized and complex, requiring more complex controls to operate them
Computers have the ability to perform a wide range of tasks, but their static physical form limits interaction possibilities
New types of interfaces are needed to capture the rich dexterity of human hands and allow for new ways of interaction
Applications of Dynamic Shape Displays
InFORM allows urban planners to design and view entire cities in a dynamic and physical way
Dynamic shape displays enable remote collaboration by allowing users to manipulate objects at a distance
Collaboration on 3D data sets is enhanced through gesture-based interactions and physical manipulation
Expanding the Possibilities of Mobile Devices
Mobile devices have a static physical form that limits their versatility across different applications
Haptic edge display brings dynamic shape change to mobile devices, allowing users to feel their position and interact with emerging buttons
Pneumatic actuation and deformable interfaces offer new possibilities for shape-changing mobile devices",stop,"[0.1522604525089264, 0.2221277952194214, 0.2391076534986496, 0.21812818944454193]","[0.30952380952380953, 0.3645833333333333, 0.3655913978494624, 0.3905325443786982]","[0.03614457831325301, 0.06315789473684211, 0.05434782608695652, 0.059880239520958084]","[0.19047619047619047, 0.21875, 0.2150537634408602, 0.2366863905325444]",0,0.9947916666666666,1,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,9,2.9,4.4,4.45,4.05,"{'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 0.3, 'top_p': 1, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

 ${text}",[[]],0,"My grandfather was a cobbler. Back in the day, he made custom-made shoes. I never got to meet him. He perished in the Holocaust. But I did inherit his love for making, except that it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see, while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity, it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved, and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with 3D printing, and it all started with this, the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who invented 3D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today, the big idea that I want to discuss with you, is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future, but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage, and it's going to usher in a new era of localized, distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples? Anybody? Wouldn't it be awesome if you could, for the first time, get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly, so chances are, the hinges are not going to break? But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time, she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down, but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics, but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine, a little bit more elegant, and lightweight, and like good tailors, we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said, it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what? She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right? And their customers and the environment. But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources, a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship, it costs a fraction of its cost, and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts, and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone, the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional, usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. How about food? What if we could, for the first time, make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here, that are edible? What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed? And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste, which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner? And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics, perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me, will we have a 3D printer in every home? I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, how will 3D printing change my life? Or, in other words, what room in my house will 3D printing fit in? So everything that you see here has been 3D printed, including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-local manufacturing.

When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me, will we have a 3D printer in every home? I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, how will 3D printing change my life? Or, in other words, what room in my house will 3D printing fit in? So everything that you see here has been 3D printed, including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-local manufacturing. My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl, and my father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized 3D printed shoes. He passed away three years ago. But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all, is right here in the house today, and thanks to him, I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say that I am a cobbler too, and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the future. Thank you. (Applause)

","The Impact of 3D Printing on Craftsmanship and Manufacturing

The technology is becoming more accessible to startups and smaller companies, leading to innovative projects
The Future Potential and Challenges of 3D Printing
3D printing has the potential to change the food industry, allowing for edible creations and personalized nutrition
It offers job opportunities and the ability for anyone to become a maker and manufacturer
However, there are challenges such as counterfeiting and illegal possession that come with the democratization of 3D printing technology",stop,"[0.15158356726169586, 0.17772789299488068, 0.24994154274463654, 0.18831782042980194]","[0.3506493506493506, 0.3058823529411765, 0.46511627906976744, 0.40816326530612246]","[0.13157894736842102, 0.09523809523809523, 0.15294117647058822, 0.08275862068965517]","[0.23376623376623376, 0.19999999999999998, 0.26744186046511625, 0.21768707482993194]",0,1.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,1,3,9,2.95,4.65,4.35,4.3,"{'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 0.3, 'top_p': 1, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why. (Laughter) Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle. Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. I read about him in the New York Times, in the obituaries. The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature. I read the obituaries almost every day. My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a ""Let's see who died today."" (Laughter) But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures. An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries. In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data -- a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. And we began to think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times? Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured -- even if you aren't around to enjoy it? (Laughter) Would this go better with scrambled eggs? (Laughter) And so, we looked at the data. 2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016. What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us? Well, first we looked at words. This here is an obituary headline. This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew. If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime. Just looking at these is fascinating. Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years. Try and guess who they are. [An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince. [Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century] Oh, yes. [Muhammad Ali] [Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha Hadid. So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing, where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words -- ""the,"" ""and,"" -- the kind of words you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" -- and leaves you with the most significant words. And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors. And this is what it looks like. Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful. And while we're talking profession, let's look at age -- the average age at which they achieved things. That number is 37. What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for -- on average -- 44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 -- on average. (Laughter) Talk about having to be patient. (Laughter) Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s. And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of politics. (Laughter) Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s. (Laughter) If you're wondering what ""others"" are, here are some examples. Isn't it fascinating, the things people do and the things they're remembered for? (Laughter) Our curiosity was in overdrive, and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor. So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous. Famous people -- Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid -- people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly. I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names. Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous. So what if we analyze these two groups separately -- the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell us? Take a look. Two things leap out at me. First: ""John."" (Laughter) Anyone here named John should thank your parents -- (Laughter) and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone. And second: ""help."" We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print could teach us. The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life, and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things. They made a positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped. So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john.

What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives.

And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort. In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. (Laughter) We're doing two different -- OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... (Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. (Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. (Applause)",Augmented-reality maps,"user:

I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live.

So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth.

About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort. In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"You may know this feeling: you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone. Your calendar is already packed with meetings, sometimes double- or triple-booked. You feel engaged, you feel busy. In fact, you feel productive. But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. You try to figure out what it is. But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. (Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. ""The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."" This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. It only had 81 pages. And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. Try it, and let me know how it works for you. I would love to hear from you. Thank you. (Applause)",Be humble -- and other lessons from the philosophy of water,"user:

When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better.

You may know this feeling: you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone. Your calendar is already packed with meetings, sometimes double- or triple-booked. You feel engaged, you feel busy. In fact, you feel productive. But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. You try to figure out what it is. But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. (Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. ""The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."" This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. It only had 81 pages. And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again.

I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much. (Applause)

(Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)",Teachers need real feedback,"user:

They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)",Teachers need real feedback,"user:

Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)",AI isn't as smart as you think -- but it could be,"user:

What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right.

And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI.

A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all.

Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

(Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses.

And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did.

Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive.

And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does. AJ: And I love you. Thank you so much for letting me be of service. Bless you. (Applause)",How online abuse of women has spiraled out of control,"user:

[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does. AJ: And I love you. Thank you so much for letting me be of service. Bless you. (Applause)",How online abuse of women has spiraled out of control,"user:

""Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut. ""You can't sue someone for calling them a cunt."" ""If you can't handle the Internet, fuck off, whore."" ""I wish Ashley Judd would die a horrible death. She is the absolute worst."" ""Ashley Judd, you're the reason women shouldn't vote."" ""'Twisted' is such a bad movie, I don't even want to rape it."" ""Whatever you do, don't tell Ashley Judd. She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."" ""If I had to fuck an older woman, oh my God, I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd, that bitch is hot af. The unforgivable shit I would do to her."" Online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy, and it is imperative that it ends. (Applause) Girls' and women's voices, and our allies' voices are constrained in ways that are personally, economically, professionally and politically damaging. And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun.

So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does.

""Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut. ""You can't sue someone for calling them a cunt."" ""If you can't handle the Internet, fuck off, whore."" ""I wish Ashley Judd would die a horrible death. She is the absolute worst."" ""Ashley Judd, you're the reason women shouldn't vote."" ""'Twisted' is such a bad movie, I don't even want to rape it."" ""Whatever you do, don't tell Ashley Judd. She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."" ""If I had to fuck an older woman, oh my God, I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd, that bitch is hot af. The unforgivable shit I would do to her."" Online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy, and it is imperative that it ends. (Applause) Girls' and women's voices, and our allies' voices are constrained in ways that are personally, economically, professionally and politically damaging. And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"How many of us have ever seen something, thought that we should report it, but decided not to? And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:

And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)

And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth.

So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:
suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
How many of us have ever seen something, thought that we should report it, but decided not to? And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people.

suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair.

But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)

And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)

","The Celebration and Consequences of Perfectionism
Perfectionism is often admired and seen as a sign of success, but it can lead to discontentment and mental health issues
Rates of perfectionism have been rising, particularly among young people, and are associated with increased mental illness
Society's emphasis on personal freedom and unrestricted choice may contribute to the rise of perfectionism
The Influence of Social Media and Work Culture
Young people are increasingly preoccupied with attaining the perfect image, status, and lifestyle, as displayed on social media platforms
The American dream and the belief in hard work as the key to success perpetuate the idea of perfectionism
Education systems that prioritize measurement and rankings contribute to young people's need to strive for perfection
The Cycle of Self-Defeat and the Need for Change
Perfectionism is about perfecting the self, leading to a never-ending cycle of striving for unattainable perfection
Socially prescribed perfectionism, the belief that others expect perfection, is the most problematic element of perfectionism and is strongly correlated with mental illness
Perfectionism can be addressed through self-compassion and support from caregivers, but society as a whole needs to reevaluate its emphasis on competition and evaluation",stop,"[0.2569436728954315, 0.10922213643789291, 0.23384444415569305, 0.12961579859256744]","[0.38823529411764707, 0.30270270270270266, 0.3597883597883598, 0.2823529411764706]","[0.07142857142857144, 0.07650273224043716, 0.08556149732620322, 0.07142857142857144]","[0.2941176470588235, 0.20540540540540544, 0.20105820105820105, 0.18823529411764706]",0,1.0,0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0,1,3,9,2.95,4.6,4.4,4.15,"{'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 0.3, 'top_p': 1, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Please, stand up. If you're able. Thank you. I want you to feel like I felt, when I was getting sentenced. It's August 17, 2012. I’m handcuffed and standing for four long hours while the judge is reading my sentence. You're in a small cage and you're surrounded by 10 prison guards in balaclavas. There is also a guard dog who is barking at you angrily because the dog is trained to be suspicious towards people who smell like prison. Even a nice little doge is angry at me. I'm stripped down from my humanity. I'm reduced to being just a prisoner. I'm 22 and I smell like prison. The prosecutor asked for three years in jail for me. My crime is considered to be severe, and it means that the judge can give me up to seven years in jail. And as I'm standing here handcuffed behind the bars, I’m thinking to myself: Can one person change the world? Is it even worth trying? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Will I be able to achieve my dreams or I'm going to be inevitably smashed by the system? I ran away from home when I was 16 years old. I jumped on a plane, went from Siberia to Moscow. I was 16 and I was a dreamer. And I knew that I want two things in life. I want to be able to dream wildly and to be able to make my utopian dreams come true. For that, I knew I needed to be in Moscow. I was studying philosophy and I was stealing food and clothes in order to survive. When I turned 22, I got arrested for resisting to one of the most dangerous dictators on planet Earth. At the day of my arrest, my daughter turned four. You can sit down if you want. What is my crime exactly? I sang a song. ""Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin."" Me and four other members of Pussy Riot came to Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and we preached to the people of Russia from the holy place that for thousands of years was reserved only for the male preachers and, in particular, for the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, who today sends Russians to kill and to die in Ukraine. We sang our song on February 21 of 2012. We did it in response to Putin's announcement that he wants to rule Russia pretty much indefinitely. I dropped everything I was doing, and I promised to myself that I'm going to dedicate my life to resistance. I felt deep inside me that Putin equals death, medieval torture, knife in the back, stagnation, new Dark Ages for Russia. To resist, we used our loud voices, bright ski masks, dresses, courage, commitment and performance art. We would show up in public places, unannounced, guerrilla style. No permits at all. And perform, preach. We performed in government buildings, squares, shopping malls, and we would get arrested almost every single day, get out and go back to action. Our job was to show the people of Russia that resisting is indeed an option. The supreme, sacred, holy rule in Putin's Russia is to remain afraid. We decided to break this rule. By breaking this rule, we disrupted the game as such. We exposed it as a mere game. We said that the emperor is naked. Did we achieve what we wanted? As I'm standing behind the bars, handcuffed, I'm asking myself this question. Yes and no. As I said in my closing statement, we are behind the prison bars, but we are freer than people who are prosecuting us because we can say whatever we want to say and they can say only things that the government censorship allows them to say. Despite of the global movement in support of Pussy Riot, we got convicted to two years in jail. The hell was in front of me. I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona. It's unique in Russia, free of censorship, [an] independent media outlet. In 2022, we raised seven million dollars in two days for Ukraine. When reproductive rights became under attack in the United States, we raised close to one million dollars for Planned Parenthood. We started Unicorn DAO and raised two million dollars to collect art made by women and non-binary people. I really wish I could tell all of this to a 22-year-old version of myself that is standing behind the bars, separated from her family, not knowing what's going to happen next. Much work remains to be done. My friends and family are getting beaten, imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and murdered back home. In March 2023, I was put on Russia's most-wanted list. I'm facing new criminal charges for the art I made. Why? Because I said that the emperor is naked and because he is, in fact, naked, he's scared of it. We shattered the world of appearances and we said that living a lie is indeed living a lie. And it's dangerous for any dictatorship. The reason why I became a threat to the system, not because of any actual physical power that I have, but because courage is contagious. And any act of speaking the truth can cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness. And we all have this power. It's a moral act to use this power. You may or may not achieve the results that you wanted, but there is eternal beauty in trying to find truth, in risking everything you've got for what's right, stop calculating your profit and just taking a leap of faith. Courage is an ability to act in the face of fear. And some of us have chosen to live courageously. For some of us, it's not a choice. It's a matter of survival, like for our Ukrainian friends. Vladimir Putin became intimidated by Ukraine choosing the path of freedom and democracy. That's why the Russian army bombs maternity wards, schools, hospitals, rapes and kills civilians and throws their bodies in mass graves. Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side. The world is with the brave people of Ukraine. And in your final hour, when you pray to whoever you're going to be praying to, know that she is on our side. She's on the side of truth. (Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime. He said in his closing statement, ""I know that the day will come when the darkness engulfing our country will dissipate. This day will come as inevitably as spring comes to replace even the frostiest winter."" And I'll finish my speech with words of ... 22-year-old version of myself.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Please, stand up. If you're able. Thank you. I want you to feel like I felt, when I was getting sentenced. It's August 17, 2012. I’m handcuffed and standing for four long hours while the judge is reading my sentence. You're in a small cage and you're surrounded by 10 prison guards in balaclavas. There is also a guard dog who is barking at you angrily because the dog is trained to be suspicious towards people who smell like prison. Even a nice little doge is angry at me. I'm stripped down from my humanity. I'm reduced to being just a prisoner. I'm 22 and I smell like prison. The prosecutor asked for three years in jail for me. My crime is considered to be severe, and it means that the judge can give me up to seven years in jail. And as I'm standing here handcuffed behind the bars, I’m thinking to myself: Can one person change the world? Is it even worth trying? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Will I be able to achieve my dreams or I'm going to be inevitably smashed by the system? I ran away from home when I was 16 years old. I jumped on a plane, went from Siberia to Moscow. I was 16 and I was a dreamer. And I knew that I want two things in life. I want to be able to dream wildly and to be able to make my utopian dreams come true. For that, I knew I needed to be in Moscow. I was studying philosophy and I was stealing food and clothes in order to survive. When I turned 22, I got arrested for resisting to one of the most dangerous dictators on planet Earth. At the day of my arrest, my daughter turned four. You can sit down if you want. What is my crime exactly? I sang a song. ""Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin."" Me and four other members of Pussy Riot came to Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and we preached to the people of Russia from the holy place that for thousands of years was reserved only for the male preachers and, in particular, for the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, who today sends Russians to kill and to die in Ukraine. We sang our song on February 21 of 2012. We did it in response to Putin's announcement that he wants to rule Russia pretty much indefinitely. I dropped everything I was doing, and I promised to myself that I'm going to dedicate my life to resistance. I felt deep inside me that Putin equals death, medieval torture, knife in the back, stagnation, new Dark Ages for Russia. To resist, we used our loud voices, bright ski masks, dresses, courage, commitment and performance art. We would show up in public places, unannounced, guerrilla style. No permits at all. And perform, preach. We performed in government buildings, squares, shopping malls, and we would get arrested almost every single day, get out and go back to action. Our job was to show the people of Russia that resisting is indeed an option. The supreme, sacred, holy rule in Putin's Russia is to remain afraid. We decided to break this rule. By breaking this rule, we disrupted the game as such. We exposed it as a mere game. We said that the emperor is naked. Did we achieve what we wanted? As I'm standing behind the bars, handcuffed, I'm asking myself this question. Yes and no. As I said in my closing statement, we are behind the prison bars, but we are freer than people who are prosecuting us because we can say whatever we want to say and they can say only things that the government censorship allows them to say. Despite of the global movement in support of Pussy Riot, we got convicted to two years in jail. The hell was in front of me. I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona. It's unique in Russia, free of censorship, [an] independent media outlet. In 2022, we raised seven million dollars in two days for Ukraine. When reproductive rights became under attack in the United States, we raised close to one million dollars for Planned Parenthood. We started Unicorn DAO and raised two million dollars to collect art made by women and non-binary people. I really wish I could tell all of this to a 22-year-old version of myself that is standing behind the bars, separated from her family, not knowing what's going to happen next. Much work remains to be done. My friends and family are getting beaten, imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and murdered back home. In March 2023, I was put on Russia's most-wanted list. I'm facing new criminal charges for the art I made. Why? Because I said that the emperor is naked and because he is, in fact, naked, he's scared of it. We shattered the world of appearances and we said that living a lie is indeed living a lie. And it's dangerous for any dictatorship. The reason why I became a threat to the system, not because of any actual physical power that I have, but because courage is contagious. And any act of speaking the truth can cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness. And we all have this power. It's a moral act to use this power. You may or may not achieve the results that you wanted, but there is eternal beauty in trying to find truth, in risking everything you've got for what's right, stop calculating your profit and just taking a leap of faith. Courage is an ability to act in the face of fear. And some of us have chosen to live courageously. For some of us, it's not a choice. It's a matter of survival, like for our Ukrainian friends. Vladimir Putin became intimidated by Ukraine choosing the path of freedom and democracy. That's why the Russian army bombs maternity wards, schools, hospitals, rapes and kills civilians and throws their bodies in mass graves. Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side. The world is with the brave people of Ukraine. And in your final hour, when you pray to whoever you're going to be praying to, know that she is on our side. She's on the side of truth. (Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime. He said in his closing statement, ""I know that the day will come when the darkness engulfing our country will dissipate.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)",Shape-shifting tech will change work as we know it,"user:

And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons.

Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

But I did inherit his love for making, except that it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see, while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity, it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved, and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with 3D printing, and it all started with this, the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who invented 3D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today, the big idea that I want to discuss with you, is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future, but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage, and it's going to usher in a new era of localized, distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples? Anybody? Wouldn't it be awesome if you could, for the first time, get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly, so chances are, the hinges are not going to break? But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time, she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down, but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics, but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine, a little bit more elegant, and lightweight, and like good tailors, we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said, it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what? She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right? And their customers and the environment. But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources, a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship, it costs a fraction of its cost, and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts, and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone, the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional, usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. How about food? What if we could, for the first time, make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here, that are edible? What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed? And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste, which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner? And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics, perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me, will we have a 3D printer in every home? I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, how will 3D printing change my life? Or, in other words, what room in my house will 3D printing fit in? So everything that you see here has been 3D printed, including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show.

What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed? And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste, which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner? And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics, perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me, will we have a 3D printer in every home? I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, how will 3D printing change my life? Or, in other words, what room in my house will 3D printing fit in? So everything that you see here has been 3D printed, including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-local manufacturing. My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl, and my father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized 3D printed shoes. He passed away three years ago. But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all, is right here in the house today, and thanks to him, I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say that I am a cobbler too, and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the future. Thank you. (Applause)

But I did inherit his love for making, except that it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see, while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity, it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved, and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with 3D printing, and it all started with this, the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who invented 3D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today, the big idea that I want to discuss with you, is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future, but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage, and it's going to usher in a new era of localized, distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples? Anybody? Wouldn't it be awesome if you could, for the first time, get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly, so chances are, the hinges are not going to break? But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time, she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down, but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics, but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine, a little bit more elegant, and lightweight, and like good tailors, we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said, it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what? She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Joseph Keller used to jog around the Stanford campus, and he was struck by all the women jogging there as well. Why did their ponytails swing from side to side like that? Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why. (Laughter) Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle. Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. I read about him in the New York Times, in the obituaries. The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature. I read the obituaries almost every day. My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a ""Let's see who died today."" (Laughter) But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures. An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries. In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data -- a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. And we began to think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times? Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured -- even if you aren't around to enjoy it? (Laughter) Would this go better with scrambled eggs? (Laughter) And so, we looked at the data. 2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016. What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us? Well, first we looked at words. This here is an obituary headline. This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew. If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime. Just looking at these is fascinating. Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years. Try and guess who they are. [An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince. [Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century] Oh, yes. [Muhammad Ali] [Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha Hadid. So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing, where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words -- ""the,"" ""and,"" -- the kind of words you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" -- and leaves you with the most significant words. And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors. And this is what it looks like. Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful. And while we're talking profession, let's look at age -- the average age at which they achieved things. That number is 37. What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for -- on average -- 44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 -- on average. (Laughter) Talk about having to be patient. (Laughter) Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s. And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of politics. (Laughter) Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s. (Laughter) If you're wondering what ""others"" are, here are some examples. Isn't it fascinating, the things people do and the things they're remembered for? (Laughter) Our curiosity was in overdrive, and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor. So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous. Famous people -- Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid -- people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly. I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names. Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous. So what if we analyze these two groups separately -- the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell us? Take a look. Two things leap out at me. First: ""John."" (Laughter) Anyone here named John should thank your parents -- (Laughter) and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone. And second: ""help."" We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print could teach us. The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life, and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things. They made a positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped. So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society? Because the most powerful lesson here is, if more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death, the world would be a much better place. Thank you.

Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why. (Laughter) Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle. Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. I read about him in the New York Times, in the obituaries. The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature. I read the obituaries almost every day. My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a ""Let's see who died today."" (Laughter) But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures. An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries. In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data -- a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. And we began to think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times? Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured -- even if you aren't around to enjoy it? (Laughter) Would this go better with scrambled eggs? (Laughter) And so, we looked at the data. 2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016. What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us? Well, first we looked at words. This here is an obituary headline. This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew. If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime. Just looking at these is fascinating. Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years. Try and guess who they are. [An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince. [Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century] Oh, yes. [Muhammad Ali] [Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha Hadid. So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing, where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words -- ""the,"" ""and,"" -- the kind of words you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" -- and leaves you with the most significant words. And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors. And this is what it looks like. Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful. And while we're talking profession, let's look at age -- the average age at which they achieved things. That number is 37. What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for -- on average -- 44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 -- on average. (Laughter) Talk about having to be patient. (Laughter) Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s. And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of politics. (Laughter) Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s. (Laughter) If you're wondering what ""others"" are, here are some examples. Isn't it fascinating, the things people do and the things they're remembered for? (Laughter) Our curiosity was in overdrive, and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor. So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous. Famous people -- Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid -- people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly. I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names. Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous. So what if we analyze these two groups separately -- the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell us? Take a look. Two things leap out at me. First: ""John."" (Laughter) Anyone here named John should thank your parents -- (Laughter) and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone. And second: ""help."" We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print could teach us. The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life, and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things. They made a positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped. So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)","Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality","user:

What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute.

So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5.

And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. (Laughter) We're doing two different -- OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... (Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. (Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. (Applause)",Augmented-reality maps,"user:

Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. (Laughter) We're doing two different -- OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... (Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. (Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. (Applause)",Augmented-reality maps,"user:

About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort. In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"You may know this feeling: you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone. Your calendar is already packed with meetings, sometimes double- or triple-booked. You feel engaged, you feel busy. In fact, you feel productive. But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. You try to figure out what it is. But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. (Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. ""The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."" This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. It only had 81 pages. And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. Try it, and let me know how it works for you. I would love to hear from you. Thank you. (Applause)",Be humble -- and other lessons from the philosophy of water,"user:

But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. (Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. ""The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."" This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. It only had 81 pages. And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much. (Applause)

(Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)",Teachers need real feedback,"user:

They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)",Teachers need real feedback,"user:

Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us.

Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)

And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)",AI isn't as smart as you think -- but it could be,"user:
suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya.""

And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses.""

So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins.

And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does.

It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does. AJ: And I love you. Thank you so much for letting me be of service. Bless you. (Applause)

The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass.""

We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does. AJ: And I love you. Thank you so much for letting me be of service. Bless you. (Applause)

And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:

So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:
suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
How many of us have ever seen something, thought that we should report it, but decided not to? And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)",Our dangerous obsession with perfectionism is getting worse,"user:

Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work.

And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)

","The Celebration and Consequences of Perfectionism
Perfectionism is often seen as a desirable trait, but it can lead to feelings of discontent and dissatisfaction
Perfectionism is associated with a range of psychological difficulties, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders
Perfectionism has been on the rise in recent years, coinciding with an increase in mental illness among young people
The Influence of Society on Perfectionism
Society's emphasis on material wealth and status contributes to the pursuit of a perfect life and lifestyle
Social media platforms amplify the importance of appearance and perfection, creating a culture where the appearance of perfection is more important than reality
The idea of the American dream and the belief that hard work always pays off perpetuates the notion of perfectionism and personal value tied to wealth and status
The Alarming Rise of Socially Prescribed Perfectionism
Socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that others expect perfection, has seen the largest increase among the three elements of perfectionism
Socially prescribed perfectionism is strongly correlated with serious mental illness
Projections indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism by 2050",stop,"[0.32224664092063904, 0.15972012281417847, 0.21030926704406738, 0.1321229189634323]","[0.3764705882352941, 0.28108108108108104, 0.3280423280423281, 0.18823529411764706]","[0.08333333333333333, 0.04371584699453552, 0.0748663101604278, 0.04761904761904762]","[0.27058823529411763, 0.20540540540540544, 0.1798941798941799, 0.17647058823529413]",0,1.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,1,3,9,2.9,4.7,4.3,4.3,"{'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 0.3, 'top_p': 1, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Please, stand up. If you're able. Thank you. I want you to feel like I felt, when I was getting sentenced. It's August 17, 2012. I’m handcuffed and standing for four long hours while the judge is reading my sentence. You're in a small cage and you're surrounded by 10 prison guards in balaclavas. There is also a guard dog who is barking at you angrily because the dog is trained to be suspicious towards people who smell like prison. Even a nice little doge is angry at me. I'm stripped down from my humanity. I'm reduced to being just a prisoner. I'm 22 and I smell like prison. The prosecutor asked for three years in jail for me. My crime is considered to be severe, and it means that the judge can give me up to seven years in jail. And as I'm standing here handcuffed behind the bars, I’m thinking to myself: Can one person change the world? Is it even worth trying? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Will I be able to achieve my dreams or I'm going to be inevitably smashed by the system? I ran away from home when I was 16 years old. I jumped on a plane, went from Siberia to Moscow. I was 16 and I was a dreamer. And I knew that I want two things in life. I want to be able to dream wildly and to be able to make my utopian dreams come true. For that, I knew I needed to be in Moscow. I was studying philosophy and I was stealing food and clothes in order to survive. When I turned 22, I got arrested for resisting to one of the most dangerous dictators on planet Earth. At the day of my arrest, my daughter turned four. You can sit down if you want. What is my crime exactly? I sang a song. ""Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin."" Me and four other members of Pussy Riot came to Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and we preached to the people of Russia from the holy place that for thousands of years was reserved only for the male preachers and, in particular, for the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, who today sends Russians to kill and to die in Ukraine. We sang our song on February 21 of 2012. We did it in response to Putin's announcement that he wants to rule Russia pretty much indefinitely. I dropped everything I was doing, and I promised to myself that I'm going to dedicate my life to resistance. I felt deep inside me that Putin equals death, medieval torture, knife in the back, stagnation, new Dark Ages for Russia. To resist, we used our loud voices, bright ski masks, dresses, courage, commitment and performance art. We would show up in public places, unannounced, guerrilla style. No permits at all. And perform, preach. We performed in government buildings, squares, shopping malls, and we would get arrested almost every single day, get out and go back to action. Our job was to show the people of Russia that resisting is indeed an option. The supreme, sacred, holy rule in Putin's Russia is to remain afraid. We decided to break this rule. By breaking this rule, we disrupted the game as such. We exposed it as a mere game. We said that the emperor is naked. Did we achieve what we wanted? As I'm standing behind the bars, handcuffed, I'm asking myself this question. Yes and no. As I said in my closing statement, we are behind the prison bars, but we are freer than people who are prosecuting us because we can say whatever we want to say and they can say only things that the government censorship allows them to say. Despite of the global movement in support of Pussy Riot, we got convicted to two years in jail. The hell was in front of me. I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona. It's unique in Russia, free of censorship, [an] independent media outlet. In 2022, we raised seven million dollars in two days for Ukraine. When reproductive rights became under attack in the United States, we raised close to one million dollars for Planned Parenthood. We started Unicorn DAO and raised two million dollars to collect art made by women and non-binary people. I really wish I could tell all of this to a 22-year-old version of myself that is standing behind the bars, separated from her family, not knowing what's going to happen next. Much work remains to be done. My friends and family are getting beaten, imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and murdered back home. In March 2023, I was put on Russia's most-wanted list. I'm facing new criminal charges for the art I made. Why? Because I said that the emperor is naked and because he is, in fact, naked, he's scared of it. We shattered the world of appearances and we said that living a lie is indeed living a lie. And it's dangerous for any dictatorship. The reason why I became a threat to the system, not because of any actual physical power that I have, but because courage is contagious. And any act of speaking the truth can cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness. And we all have this power. It's a moral act to use this power. You may or may not achieve the results that you wanted, but there is eternal beauty in trying to find truth, in risking everything you've got for what's right, stop calculating your profit and just taking a leap of faith. Courage is an ability to act in the face of fear. And some of us have chosen to live courageously. For some of us, it's not a choice. It's a matter of survival, like for our Ukrainian friends. Vladimir Putin became intimidated by Ukraine choosing the path of freedom and democracy. That's why the Russian army bombs maternity wards, schools, hospitals, rapes and kills civilians and throws their bodies in mass graves. Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side. The world is with the brave people of Ukraine. And in your final hour, when you pray to whoever you're going to be praying to, know that she is on our side. She's on the side of truth. (Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime. He said in his closing statement, ""I know that the day will come when the darkness engulfing our country will dissipate. This day will come as inevitably as spring comes to replace even the frostiest winter."" And I'll finish my speech with words of ... 22-year-old version of myself.

I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona. It's unique in Russia, free of censorship, [an] independent media outlet. In 2022, we raised seven million dollars in two days for Ukraine. When reproductive rights became under attack in the United States, we raised close to one million dollars for Planned Parenthood. We started Unicorn DAO and raised two million dollars to collect art made by women and non-binary people. I really wish I could tell all of this to a 22-year-old version of myself that is standing behind the bars, separated from her family, not knowing what's going to happen next. Much work remains to be done. My friends and family are getting beaten, imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and murdered back home. In March 2023, I was put on Russia's most-wanted list. I'm facing new criminal charges for the art I made. Why? Because I said that the emperor is naked and because he is, in fact, naked, he's scared of it. We shattered the world of appearances and we said that living a lie is indeed living a lie. And it's dangerous for any dictatorship. The reason why I became a threat to the system, not because of any actual physical power that I have, but because courage is contagious. And any act of speaking the truth can cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness. And we all have this power. It's a moral act to use this power. You may or may not achieve the results that you wanted, but there is eternal beauty in trying to find truth, in risking everything you've got for what's right, stop calculating your profit and just taking a leap of faith. Courage is an ability to act in the face of fear. And some of us have chosen to live courageously. For some of us, it's not a choice. It's a matter of survival, like for our Ukrainian friends. Vladimir Putin became intimidated by Ukraine choosing the path of freedom and democracy. That's why the Russian army bombs maternity wards, schools, hospitals, rapes and kills civilians and throws their bodies in mass graves. Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side. The world is with the brave people of Ukraine. And in your final hour, when you pray to whoever you're going to be praying to, know that she is on our side. She's on the side of truth. (Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime. He said in his closing statement, ""I know that the day will come when the darkness engulfing our country will dissipate. This day will come as inevitably as spring comes to replace even the frostiest winter."" And I'll finish my speech with words of ... 22-year-old version of myself. I said in my closing statement, ""Passion, openness and naivete are superior to hypocrisy, cunning and contrived decency that conceals crimes. (In Russian) Open all doors, take off the epaulettes, feel the smell of freedom with us.” Thank you. (Applause and cheers)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)",Shape-shifting tech will change work as we know it,"user:

However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

But all of that is about to change with 3D printing, and it all started with this, the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who invented 3D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today, the big idea that I want to discuss with you, is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future, but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage, and it's going to usher in a new era of localized, distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples? Anybody?

But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time, she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down, but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics, but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine, a little bit more elegant, and lightweight, and like good tailors, we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said, it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what? She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right? And their customers and the environment. But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources, a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship, it costs a fraction of its cost, and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts, and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone, the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional, usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. How about food? What if we could, for the first time, make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here, that are edible?

And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics, perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession.

It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right? And their customers and the environment. But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources, a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship, it costs a fraction of its cost, and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts, and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone, the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional, usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. How about food? What if we could, for the first time, make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here, that are edible? What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed? And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste, which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner? And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics, perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me, will we have a 3D printer in every home? I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, how will 3D printing change my life? Or, in other words, what room in my house will 3D printing fit in? So everything that you see here has been 3D printed, including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-local manufacturing. My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl, and my father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized 3D printed shoes. He passed away three years ago. But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all, is right here in the house today, and thanks to him, I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say that I am a cobbler too, and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the future. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Joseph Keller used to jog around the Stanford campus, and he was struck by all the women jogging there as well. Why did their ponytails swing from side to side like that? Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why. (Laughter) Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle. Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. I read about him in the New York Times, in the obituaries. The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature. I read the obituaries almost every day. My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a ""Let's see who died today."" (Laughter) But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures. An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries. In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data -- a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. And we began to think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times? Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured -- even if you aren't around to enjoy it? (Laughter) Would this go better with scrambled eggs? (Laughter) And so, we looked at the data. 2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016. What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us? Well, first we looked at words. This here is an obituary headline. This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew. If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime. Just looking at these is fascinating. Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years. Try and guess who they are. [An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince. [Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century] Oh, yes. [Muhammad Ali] [Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha Hadid. So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing, where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words -- ""the,"" ""and,"" -- the kind of words you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" -- and leaves you with the most significant words. And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors. And this is what it looks like. Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful. And while we're talking profession, let's look at age -- the average age at which they achieved things. That number is 37. What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for -- on average -- 44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 -- on average. (Laughter) Talk about having to be patient. (Laughter) Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s. And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of politics. (Laughter) Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s. (Laughter) If you're wondering what ""others"" are, here are some examples. Isn't it fascinating, the things people do and the things they're remembered for? (Laughter) Our curiosity was in overdrive, and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor. So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous. Famous people -- Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid -- people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly. I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names. Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous. So what if we analyze these two groups separately -- the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell us? Take a look. Two things leap out at me. First: ""John."" (Laughter) Anyone here named John should thank your parents -- (Laughter) and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone. And second: ""help."" We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print could teach us. The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life, and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things. They made a positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped. So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society?

(Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)","Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality","user:

Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)","Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality","user:
suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort. In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. (Laughter) We're doing two different -- OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... (Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. (Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. (Applause)",Augmented-reality maps,"user:

These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. (Laughter) We're doing two different -- OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... (Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. (Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. (Applause)",Augmented-reality maps,"user:

About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort. In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"You may know this feeling: you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone. Your calendar is already packed with meetings, sometimes double- or triple-booked. You feel engaged, you feel busy. In fact, you feel productive. But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. You try to figure out what it is. But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. (Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. ""The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."" This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. It only had 81 pages. And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. Try it, and let me know how it works for you. I would love to hear from you. Thank you. (Applause)",Be humble -- and other lessons from the philosophy of water,"user:

And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. Try it, and let me know how it works for you. I would love to hear from you. Thank you. (Applause)",Be humble -- and other lessons from the philosophy of water,"user:

You may know this feeling: you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone. Your calendar is already packed with meetings, sometimes double- or triple-booked. You feel engaged, you feel busy. In fact, you feel productive. But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. You try to figure out what it is. But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?""

Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training.

So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using.

(Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)",Teachers need real feedback,"user:

Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)",AI isn't as smart as you think -- but it could be,"user:

We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology.

So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress.

(Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects.

So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do.

And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right?

And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world.

So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things.

How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours.

Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you.

I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water.

He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

(Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does.

(Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does.

""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does.

""Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut. ""You can't sue someone for calling them a cunt."" ""If you can't handle the Internet, fuck off, whore."" ""I wish Ashley Judd would die a horrible death. She is the absolute worst."" ""Ashley Judd, you're the reason women shouldn't vote."" ""'Twisted' is such a bad movie, I don't even want to rape it."" ""Whatever you do, don't tell Ashley Judd. She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."" ""If I had to fuck an older woman, oh my God, I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd, that bitch is hot af. The unforgivable shit I would do to her."" Online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy, and it is imperative that it ends. (Applause) Girls' and women's voices, and our allies' voices are constrained in ways that are personally, economically, professionally and politically damaging. And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"How many of us have ever seen something, thought that we should report it, but decided not to? And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:

But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)

And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"How many of us have ever seen something, thought that we should report it, but decided not to? And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving.

suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing.

These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)

","The Celebration and Consequences of Perfectionism
Perfectionism is often admired and seen as a sign of success, but it can lead to discontentment and mental health issues
Rates of perfectionism have been rising, particularly among young people, and are associated with increased mental illness
Society's emphasis on personal freedom and unrestricted choice may contribute to the rise of perfectionism
The Influence of Social Media and Work Culture
Young people are increasingly preoccupied with attaining the perfect image, status, and lifestyle, as displayed on social media platforms
The American dream and the belief in hard work as the key to success perpetuate the idea of perfectionism
Education systems that prioritize measurement and rankings contribute to young people's need to strive for perfection
The Cycle of Self-Defeat and the Need for Change
Perfectionism is about perfecting the self, leading to a never-ending cycle of striving for unattainable perfection
Socially prescribed perfectionism, the belief that others expect perfection, is the most problematic element of perfectionism and is strongly correlated with mental illness
Perfectionism can be addressed through self-compassion and support from caregivers, but society as a whole needs to reevaluate its emphasis on competition and evaluation",stop,"[0.2569436728954315, 0.10922213643789291, 0.23384444415569305, 0.12961579859256744]","[0.38823529411764707, 0.30270270270270266, 0.3597883597883598, 0.2823529411764706]","[0.07142857142857144, 0.07650273224043716, 0.08556149732620322, 0.07142857142857144]","[0.2941176470588235, 0.20540540540540544, 0.20105820105820105, 0.18823529411764706]",0,1.0,0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0,1,3,9,2.9,4.55,4.6,4.2,"{'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', 'suffix': '', 'temperature': 0.3, 'top_p': 1, 'n': 1, 'stop': None}"

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions.

This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving. Thank you very much. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Please, stand up. If you're able. Thank you. I want you to feel like I felt, when I was getting sentenced. It's August 17, 2012. I’m handcuffed and standing for four long hours while the judge is reading my sentence. You're in a small cage and you're surrounded by 10 prison guards in balaclavas. There is also a guard dog who is barking at you angrily because the dog is trained to be suspicious towards people who smell like prison. Even a nice little doge is angry at me. I'm stripped down from my humanity. I'm reduced to being just a prisoner. I'm 22 and I smell like prison. The prosecutor asked for three years in jail for me. My crime is considered to be severe, and it means that the judge can give me up to seven years in jail. And as I'm standing here handcuffed behind the bars, I’m thinking to myself: Can one person change the world? Is it even worth trying? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Will I be able to achieve my dreams or I'm going to be inevitably smashed by the system? I ran away from home when I was 16 years old. I jumped on a plane, went from Siberia to Moscow. I was 16 and I was a dreamer. And I knew that I want two things in life. I want to be able to dream wildly and to be able to make my utopian dreams come true. For that, I knew I needed to be in Moscow. I was studying philosophy and I was stealing food and clothes in order to survive. When I turned 22, I got arrested for resisting to one of the most dangerous dictators on planet Earth. At the day of my arrest, my daughter turned four. You can sit down if you want. What is my crime exactly? I sang a song. ""Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin."" Me and four other members of Pussy Riot came to Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and we preached to the people of Russia from the holy place that for thousands of years was reserved only for the male preachers and, in particular, for the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, who today sends Russians to kill and to die in Ukraine. We sang our song on February 21 of 2012. We did it in response to Putin's announcement that he wants to rule Russia pretty much indefinitely. I dropped everything I was doing, and I promised to myself that I'm going to dedicate my life to resistance. I felt deep inside me that Putin equals death, medieval torture, knife in the back, stagnation, new Dark Ages for Russia. To resist, we used our loud voices, bright ski masks, dresses, courage, commitment and performance art. We would show up in public places, unannounced, guerrilla style. No permits at all. And perform, preach. We performed in government buildings, squares, shopping malls, and we would get arrested almost every single day, get out and go back to action. Our job was to show the people of Russia that resisting is indeed an option. The supreme, sacred, holy rule in Putin's Russia is to remain afraid. We decided to break this rule. By breaking this rule, we disrupted the game as such. We exposed it as a mere game. We said that the emperor is naked. Did we achieve what we wanted? As I'm standing behind the bars, handcuffed, I'm asking myself this question. Yes and no. As I said in my closing statement, we are behind the prison bars, but we are freer than people who are prosecuting us because we can say whatever we want to say and they can say only things that the government censorship allows them to say. Despite of the global movement in support of Pussy Riot, we got convicted to two years in jail. The hell was in front of me. I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona. It's unique in Russia, free of censorship, [an] independent media outlet. In 2022, we raised seven million dollars in two days for Ukraine. When reproductive rights became under attack in the United States, we raised close to one million dollars for Planned Parenthood. We started Unicorn DAO and raised two million dollars to collect art made by women and non-binary people. I really wish I could tell all of this to a 22-year-old version of myself that is standing behind the bars, separated from her family, not knowing what's going to happen next. Much work remains to be done. My friends and family are getting beaten, imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and murdered back home. In March 2023, I was put on Russia's most-wanted list. I'm facing new criminal charges for the art I made. Why? Because I said that the emperor is naked and because he is, in fact, naked, he's scared of it. We shattered the world of appearances and we said that living a lie is indeed living a lie. And it's dangerous for any dictatorship. The reason why I became a threat to the system, not because of any actual physical power that I have, but because courage is contagious. And any act of speaking the truth can cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness. And we all have this power. It's a moral act to use this power. You may or may not achieve the results that you wanted, but there is eternal beauty in trying to find truth, in risking everything you've got for what's right, stop calculating your profit and just taking a leap of faith. Courage is an ability to act in the face of fear. And some of us have chosen to live courageously. For some of us, it's not a choice. It's a matter of survival, like for our Ukrainian friends. Vladimir Putin became intimidated by Ukraine choosing the path of freedom and democracy. That's why the Russian army bombs maternity wards, schools, hospitals, rapes and kills civilians and throws their bodies in mass graves. Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side. The world is with the brave people of Ukraine. And in your final hour, when you pray to whoever you're going to be praying to, know that she is on our side. She's on the side of truth. (Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime. He said in his closing statement, ""I know that the day will come when the darkness engulfing our country will dissipate. This day will come as inevitably as spring comes to replace even the frostiest winter."" And I'll finish my speech with words of ... 22-year-old version of myself.

Despite of the global movement in support of Pussy Riot, we got convicted to two years in jail. The hell was in front of me. I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona. It's unique in Russia, free of censorship, [an] independent media outlet. In 2022, we raised seven million dollars in two days for Ukraine. When reproductive rights became under attack in the United States, we raised close to one million dollars for Planned Parenthood. We started Unicorn DAO and raised two million dollars to collect art made by women and non-binary people. I really wish I could tell all of this to a 22-year-old version of myself that is standing behind the bars, separated from her family, not knowing what's going to happen next. Much work remains to be done. My friends and family are getting beaten, imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and murdered back home. In March 2023, I was put on Russia's most-wanted list. I'm facing new criminal charges for the art I made. Why? Because I said that the emperor is naked and because he is, in fact, naked, he's scared of it. We shattered the world of appearances and we said that living a lie is indeed living a lie. And it's dangerous for any dictatorship. The reason why I became a threat to the system, not because of any actual physical power that I have, but because courage is contagious. And any act of speaking the truth can cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness. And we all have this power. It's a moral act to use this power. You may or may not achieve the results that you wanted, but there is eternal beauty in trying to find truth, in risking everything you've got for what's right, stop calculating your profit and just taking a leap of faith. Courage is an ability to act in the face of fear. And some of us have chosen to live courageously. For some of us, it's not a choice. It's a matter of survival, like for our Ukrainian friends. Vladimir Putin became intimidated by Ukraine choosing the path of freedom and democracy. That's why the Russian army bombs maternity wards, schools, hospitals, rapes and kills civilians and throws their bodies in mass graves. Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side. The world is with the brave people of Ukraine. And in your final hour, when you pray to whoever you're going to be praying to, know that she is on our side. She's on the side of truth. (Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime. He said in his closing statement, ""I know that the day will come when the darkness engulfing our country will dissipate. This day will come as inevitably as spring comes to replace even the frostiest winter."" And I'll finish my speech with words of ... 22-year-old version of myself. I said in my closing statement, ""Passion, openness and naivete are superior to hypocrisy, cunning and contrived decency that conceals crimes. (In Russian) Open all doors, take off the epaulettes, feel the smell of freedom with us.” Thank you. (Applause and cheers)

I’m handcuffed and standing for four long hours while the judge is reading my sentence. You're in a small cage and you're surrounded by 10 prison guards in balaclavas. There is also a guard dog who is barking at you angrily because the dog is trained to be suspicious towards people who smell like prison. Even a nice little doge is angry at me. I'm stripped down from my humanity. I'm reduced to being just a prisoner. I'm 22 and I smell like prison. The prosecutor asked for three years in jail for me. My crime is considered to be severe, and it means that the judge can give me up to seven years in jail. And as I'm standing here handcuffed behind the bars, I’m thinking to myself: Can one person change the world? Is it even worth trying? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Will I be able to achieve my dreams or I'm going to be inevitably smashed by the system? I ran away from home when I was 16 years old. I jumped on a plane, went from Siberia to Moscow. I was 16 and I was a dreamer. And I knew that I want two things in life. I want to be able to dream wildly and to be able to make my utopian dreams come true. For that, I knew I needed to be in Moscow. I was studying philosophy and I was stealing food and clothes in order to survive. When I turned 22, I got arrested for resisting to one of the most dangerous dictators on planet Earth. At the day of my arrest, my daughter turned four. You can sit down if you want. What is my crime exactly? I sang a song. ""Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin."" Me and four other members of Pussy Riot came to Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and we preached to the people of Russia from the holy place that for thousands of years was reserved only for the male preachers and, in particular, for the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, who today sends Russians to kill and to die in Ukraine. We sang our song on February 21 of 2012. We did it in response to Putin's announcement that he wants to rule Russia pretty much indefinitely. I dropped everything I was doing, and I promised to myself that I'm going to dedicate my life to resistance. I felt deep inside me that Putin equals death, medieval torture, knife in the back, stagnation, new Dark Ages for Russia. To resist, we used our loud voices, bright ski masks, dresses, courage, commitment and performance art. We would show up in public places, unannounced, guerrilla style. No permits at all. And perform, preach. We performed in government buildings, squares, shopping malls, and we would get arrested almost every single day, get out and go back to action. Our job was to show the people of Russia that resisting is indeed an option. The supreme, sacred, holy rule in Putin's Russia is to remain afraid. We decided to break this rule. By breaking this rule, we disrupted the game as such. We exposed it as a mere game. We said that the emperor is naked. Did we achieve what we wanted?

 ${text}",[[]],0,"We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)",Shape-shifting tech will change work as we know it,"user:

And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them.

(Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)",Shape-shifting tech will change work as we know it,"user:

We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here?

But I did inherit his love for making, except that it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see, while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity, it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved, and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with 3D printing, and it all started with this, the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who invented 3D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today, the big idea that I want to discuss with you, is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future, but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage, and it's going to usher in a new era of localized, distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples? Anybody? Wouldn't it be awesome if you could, for the first time, get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly, so chances are, the hinges are not going to break? But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time, she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down, but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics, but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine, a little bit more elegant, and lightweight, and like good tailors, we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said, it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what? She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right? And their customers and the environment. But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources, a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship, it costs a fraction of its cost, and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts, and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone, the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional, usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. How about food? What if we could, for the first time, make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here, that are edible? What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed? And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste, which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner? And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics, perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession.

My grandfather was a cobbler. Back in the day, he made custom-made shoes. I never got to meet him. He perished in the Holocaust. But I did inherit his love for making, except that it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see, while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity, it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved, and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with 3D printing, and it all started with this, the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who invented 3D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today, the big idea that I want to discuss with you, is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future, but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage, and it's going to usher in a new era of localized, distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples? Anybody? Wouldn't it be awesome if you could, for the first time, get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly, so chances are, the hinges are not going to break? But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time, she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down, but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics, but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine, a little bit more elegant, and lightweight, and like good tailors, we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said, it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what? She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right? And their customers and the environment. But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources, a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship, it costs a fraction of its cost, and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts, and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone, the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional, usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. How about food? What if we could, for the first time, make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here, that are edible? What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed? And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste, which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner? And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics, perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me, will we have a 3D printer in every home? I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, how will 3D printing change my life? Or, in other words, what room in my house will 3D printing fit in? So everything that you see here has been 3D printed, including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-local manufacturing.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Joseph Keller used to jog around the Stanford campus, and he was struck by all the women jogging there as well. Why did their ponytails swing from side to side like that? Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why. (Laughter) Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle. Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. I read about him in the New York Times, in the obituaries. The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature. I read the obituaries almost every day. My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a ""Let's see who died today."" (Laughter) But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures. An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries. In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data -- a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. And we began to think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times? Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured -- even if you aren't around to enjoy it? (Laughter) Would this go better with scrambled eggs? (Laughter) And so, we looked at the data. 2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016. What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us? Well, first we looked at words. This here is an obituary headline. This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew. If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime. Just looking at these is fascinating. Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years. Try and guess who they are. [An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince. [Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century] Oh, yes. [Muhammad Ali] [Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha Hadid. So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing, where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words -- ""the,"" ""and,"" -- the kind of words you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" -- and leaves you with the most significant words. And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors. And this is what it looks like. Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful. And while we're talking profession, let's look at age -- the average age at which they achieved things. That number is 37. What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for -- on average -- 44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 -- on average. (Laughter) Talk about having to be patient. (Laughter) Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s. And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of politics. (Laughter) Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s. (Laughter) If you're wondering what ""others"" are, here are some examples. Isn't it fascinating, the things people do and the things they're remembered for? (Laughter) Our curiosity was in overdrive, and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor. So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous. Famous people -- Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid -- people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly. I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names. Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous. So what if we analyze these two groups separately -- the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell us? Take a look. Two things leap out at me. First: ""John."" (Laughter) Anyone here named John should thank your parents -- (Laughter) and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone. And second: ""help."" We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print could teach us. The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life, and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things. They made a positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped. So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society? Because the most powerful lesson here is, if more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death, the world would be a much better place. Thank you.

Famous people -- Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid -- people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly. I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names. Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous. So what if we analyze these two groups separately -- the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell us? Take a look. Two things leap out at me. First: ""John."" (Laughter) Anyone here named John should thank your parents -- (Laughter) and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone. And second: ""help."" We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print could teach us. The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life, and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things. They made a positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped. So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society? Because the most powerful lesson here is, if more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death, the world would be a much better place. Thank you. (Applause)

Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why. (Laughter) Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle. Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. I read about him in the New York Times, in the obituaries. The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature. I read the obituaries almost every day. My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a ""Let's see who died today."" (Laughter) But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures. An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries. In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data -- a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. And we began to think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times? Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured -- even if you aren't around to enjoy it? (Laughter) Would this go better with scrambled eggs? (Laughter) And so, we looked at the data. 2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016. What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us? Well, first we looked at words. This here is an obituary headline. This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew. If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime. Just looking at these is fascinating. Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years. Try and guess who they are. [An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince. [Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century] Oh, yes. [Muhammad Ali] [Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha Hadid. So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing, where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words -- ""the,"" ""and,"" -- the kind of words you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" -- and leaves you with the most significant words. And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors. And this is what it looks like. Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful. And while we're talking profession, let's look at age -- the average age at which they achieved things. That number is 37. What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for -- on average -- 44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 -- on average. (Laughter) Talk about having to be patient. (Laughter) Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s. And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of politics. (Laughter) Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)","Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality","user:

What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation.

Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself.

But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort. In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. (Laughter) We're doing two different -- OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... (Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. (Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. (Applause)",Augmented-reality maps,"user:

If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort. In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. (Laughter) We're doing two different -- OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... (Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. (Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"You may know this feeling: you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone. Your calendar is already packed with meetings, sometimes double- or triple-booked. You feel engaged, you feel busy. In fact, you feel productive. But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. You try to figure out what it is. But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. (Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. ""The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."" This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. It only had 81 pages. And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. Try it, and let me know how it works for you. I would love to hear from you. Thank you. (Applause)",Be humble -- and other lessons from the philosophy of water,"user:

(Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. Try it, and let me know how it works for you. I would love to hear from you. Thank you. (Applause)

You feel engaged, you feel busy. In fact, you feel productive. But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. You try to figure out what it is. But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. (Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. ""The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."" This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. It only had 81 pages. And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience.""

Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. Try it, and let me know how it works for you. I would love to hear from you. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)",Teachers need real feedback,"user:

Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom.

This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)",AI isn't as smart as you think -- but it could be,"user:

An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."" I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. There are only 200 of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought, my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking? So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. (Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy.

The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. And what does that mean? After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals, these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic. These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."" Which means, ""Take my camera."" And he thinks I'm saying, ""Take my picture."" So we had this little communication breakdown. (Laughter) But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."" But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived 150 years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright, my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like, ""We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."" And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. (Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. (Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice, he goes, ""That's a bloody big seal, ya."" (Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, ""This is a good seal, ya. It's time for you to get in the water."" (Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, ""Forget that."" But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter ""F."" But he was right. He scolded me out, and said, ""This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses."" So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. He said, ""If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."" (Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. She went off, she got a penguin. She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me, takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me? And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, ""This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."" (Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. (Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, ""Are you for real?"" Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... (Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. And I thought, she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. (Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

(Applause) Girls' and women's voices, and our allies' voices are constrained in ways that are personally, economically, professionally and politically damaging. And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. (Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. (Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted. [@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. And I have responded to this with various strategies. I've tried engaging people. This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. I wrote him back and said ... ""Is that your daughter? I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way."" And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" Sometimes people want to be held accountable. This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" (Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true. Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical. Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me. On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."" And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself. And I started to write. I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. [Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained. Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. Our ability to go to school is impaired. 96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. And I want to say a word about revenge porn. Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does. AJ: And I love you. Thank you so much for letting me be of service. Bless you. (Applause)",How online abuse of women has spiraled out of control,"user:

But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. And my expressing it does not pornography make. (Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. I can often get a social media company's attention. I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. ""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."" Well, guess what? Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. (Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. We're going to win this fight. There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. Two ... shall we talk about our friends in tech? Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. (Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. And guess what, Silicon Valley? If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough. (Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. So, let's talk about our friends ... white men. You have a role to play and a choice to make. You can do something, or you can do nothing. We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. 92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. 72 percent of us have witnessed it. We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. And lastly, believe her. Believe her. (Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. I would like for you to reflect it back to me. It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" Audience: Yes, you are. Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. A: Yes, she does. AJ: I did a great job with my talk. A: Yes, you did. AJ: I have a right to be here. A: Yes, you do. AJ: I'm really cute. (Laughter) A: Yes, you are. AJ: God does good work. A: Yes, He does. AJ: And I love you. Thank you so much for letting me be of service. Bless you. (Applause)

"suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
 ${text}",[[]],0,"How many of us have ever seen something, thought that we should report it, but decided not to? And not that I need to see a show of hands, but I'm sure this has happened to someone in this room before. In fact, when this question was asked to a group of employees, 46 percent of them responded by saying that they had seen something and decided not to report it. So if you raised your hand, or quietly raised your hand, don't feel bad, you're not alone. This message of if you see something to say something is really all around us. Even when driving down the highway, you see billboards like this, encouraging us to report crime without revealing ourselves. But I still feel like a lot of us are really uncomfortable coming forward in the name of the truth. I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research. And in my class, I encourage my students to come forward with information if they see it. Or in other words, encouraging my students to become whistle-blowers. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students. And here's why. Whistle-blowers are under attack. Headline after headline shows us this. Many people choose not to become whistle-blowers due to the fear of retaliation. From demotions to death threats, to job loss -- perpetual job loss. Choosing to become a whistle-blower is an uphill battle. Their loyalty becomes into question. Their motives, their trustworthiness. So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them? So, one day I was getting ready for my annual whistle-blower lecture with my students. And I was working on an article for ""Forbes,"" entitled ""Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle-blowing. What Do We Tell Them?"" And as I was working on this piece and reading about the case, I became outraged. And what made me angry was when I came to the fact and realized that the employees that tried to whistle-blow were actually fired. And it really made me think about the message that I was sharing with my students. And it made me think: What if my students had been Wells Fargo employees? On the one hand, if they whistle-blew, they would have gotten fired. But on the other hand, if they didn't report the frauds that they knew, the way current regulation is written, employees are held responsible if they knew something and didn't report it. So criminal prosecution is a real option. What's a person supposed to do with those type of odds? I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make. In fact, most frauds are discovered by them. Forty two percent of frauds are discovered by a whistle-blower in comparison to other methods, like measurement review and external audit. And when you think about some of the more classic or historical fraud cases, it always is around a whistle-blower. Think Watergate -- discovered by a whistle-blower. Think Enron -- discovered by a whistle-blower. And who can forget about Bernard Madoff, discovered by a whistle-blower? It takes a tremendous amount of courage to come forward in the name of the truth. But when we think about the term whistle-blower, we often think of some very descriptive words: rat, snake, traitor, tattletale, weasel. And those are the nice words, the ones I can say from the stage. And so when I'm not in class, I go around the country and I interview white-collar felons, whistle-blowers and victims of fraud. Because really I'm trying to understand what makes them tick and to bring those experiences back into the classroom. But it's my interviews with whistle-blowers that really stick with me. And they stick with me, because they make me question my own courage. When given the opportunity, would I actually speak up? And so, this is a couple stories that I want to share with you. This is Mary. Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case. And Mary was a learning specialist at the university, and she worked with students, primarily student athletes. And what she noticed, when she was working with students, is they were turning in term papers that seemed well beyond their reading levels. She started to ask a couple of questions and she found out that there was a database where the student athletes could retrieve papers and turn them in. And then she found out that some of her colleagues were funneling students into fake classes, just to keep them eligible to play. Now, when Mary found this out, she was outraged. And so what she tried to do was go to her direct supervisor. But they didn't do anything. And then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators. And they didn't do anything. So, what happens when nobody listens? You blog. So Mary decided to develop a blog. Her blog went viral within 24 hours, and she was contacted by a reporter. Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports. Mary didn't do anything wrong. She didn't participate in the fraud. She really thought that she was giving voice to students that were voiceless. But her loyalty was questioned. Her trustworthiness and her motives. Now, whistle-blowing doesn't always have to end in demotions or death threats. Actually, in 2002, this was the cover of ""Time"" magazine, where we were actually honoring three brave whistle-blowers for their decision to come forward in the name of the truth. And when you look at the research, 22 percent of whistle-blowers actually report retaliation. So there is a huge population of people that report and are not retaliated against and that gives me hope. So this is Kathe. Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk from the city of Dixon. And one day, Kathe was doing her job, just like she always did, and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case. See, Kathe was at the end of the month, and she was doing her treasures report for the city, and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell, gave her a list of accounts and said, ""Kathe, call the bank and get these specific accounts."" And Kathe did her job. But this particular day, Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy. She picks up the phone, she calls the bank and says, ""Fax me all of the accounts."" And when she gets the fax, she sees that there is an account that has some withdrawals and deposits in it that she did not know about. It was an account controlled only by Rita. So Kathe looked at the information, she reported it to her direct supervisor, which was then-mayor Burke, and this led into a huge investigation, a six-month investigation. Come to find out, Kathe's boss, Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money. Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars over a 20-year period, and Kathe just happened to stumble upon it. Kathe is a hero. And actually, I had the opportunity of interviewing Kathe for my documentary, ""All the Queen's Horses."" And Kathe wasn't seeking fame. In fact, she really didn't want to talk to me for a really long time, but through strategic stalking, she ended up doing the interview. (Laughter) But she was seeking fairness, not fame. And if it wasn't for Kathe, who's to say this fraud would have ever been discovered? So, remember that ""Forbes"" article I was talking about, that I was working on before my lecture? Well, I posted it and something really fantastic happened. I started receiving emails from whistle-blowers all over the world. And as I was receiving these emails and responding back to them, there was a common theme in the message that I received, and this is what it was: they all said this, ""I blew the whistle, people really hate me now. I got fired, but guess what? I would do it all over again if I could."" And so as I kept reading this message, all these messages, I wanted to think, what could I share with my students? And so, I pulled it all together and this is what I learned. It's important for us to cultivate hope. Whistle-blowers are hopeful. Despite popular belief, they're not all disgruntled employees that have a beef with the company. Their hopefulness really is what drives them to come forward. We also have to cultivate commitment. Whistle-blowers are committed. And it's that passion to their organization that makes them want to come forward. Whistle-blowers are humble. Again, they're not seeking fame, but they are seeking fairness. And we need to continue to cultivate bravery. Whistle-blowers are brave. Often, they underestimated the impact whistle-blowing had on their family, but what they continue to comment on is how hard it is to withhold the truth. With that, I want to leave you with one additional name: Peter Buxtun. Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old employee for the US Public Health Service. And he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases. And through the course of his work, he noticed a clinical study that was going on within the organization. And it was a study that was looking at the progression of untreated syphilis. And so, there were 600 African American males that were in this study. They were enticed into the study through being given free medical exams, burial insurance. And so, what happened through the course of this study, is penicillin was discovered to help treat syphilis. And what Peter noticed was, the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis. And the participants didn't know. So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report and talk to his internal supervisors, but no one listened. And so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again, and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary. And in 1972, this was the front page of the ""New York Times"": ""Syphilis Victims in US Study Went Untreated for 40 Years."" This is known to us today as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. And Peter was the whistle-blower. What happened to the 600 men, you may wonder, the 600 original men? Twenty eight men died from syphilis. One hundred died from syphilis complications, forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with congenital syphilis. Who's to say what these numbers would be if it wasn't for the brave, courageous act of Peter? We're all connected to Peter, actually. If you know anybody that's in a clinical trial, the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter's courageous act. So let me ask you a question. That original question, a variation of the original question. How many of us have ever used the term snitch, rat tattletale, snake, weasel, leak? Anybody? Before you get the urge to do that again, I want you to think a little bit. It might be the Mary, the Peter, the Kathes of the world. You might be the person that could shape history, or they could be the person that shapes yours. Thank you. (Applause)",How whistle-blowers shape history,"user:

 ${text}",[[]],0,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Now, how many times have you heard that one? Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving. It's everyone's favorite flaw, it's that now quite common response to the difficult, final question at job interviews: ""My biggest weakness? That's my perfectionism."" You see, for something that supposedly holds us back, it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up and say we're perfectionists. But there's an interesting and serious point because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms. What does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection? We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth. The emblem of the successful. Yet, in my time studying perfectionism, I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful. Quite the contrary -- they feel discontented and dissatisfied amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough. We know from clinician case reports that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties, including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia and even suicide ideation. And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years, we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate. And at the same time, we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before. Rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades. And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada, and in my home country, the United Kingdom. Now, our research is suggesting that perfectionism is rising as society is changing. And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact with each other and the world around them. And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society that include things like unrestricted choice and personal freedom, and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing to almost epidemic levels of this problem. So let me give you an example. Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life and lifestyle. In terms of their image, status and wealth. Data from Pew show that young people born in the US in the late 1980s are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich as among their most important life goals, relative to their parents and their grandparents. Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations, and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods and status possessions. These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. In this new visual culture, the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality. If one side of the modern landscape that we have so lavishly furnished for young people is this idea that there's a perfectible life and that there's a perfectible lifestyle, then the other is surely work. Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough. Or so we're told. This is the idea at the heart of the American dream. Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work. The notion that hard work always pays off. And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny. These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status and our image with our innate, personal value. But it is, of course, complete fiction. Because even if there were equality of opportunity, the idea that we are captains of our own destiny disguises a much darker reality for young people that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal. Metrics, rankings, lead tables have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges. Education is the first arena where measurement is so publicly played out and where metrics are being used as a tool to improve standards and performance. And it starts young. Young people in America's big city high schools take some 112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade. No wonder young people report a strong need to strive, perform and achieve at the center of modern life. They've been conditioned to define themselves in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables. This is a society that preys on their insecurities. Insecurities about how they are performing and how they are appearing to other people. This is a society that amplifies their imperfections. Every flaw, every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else, bluntly, you're a failure. That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive -- just talk to young people. ""How should I look, how should I behave?"" ""I should look like that model, I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer, I must do better in school."" In my role as mentor to many young people, I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand. And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly. John, not his real name, was ambitious, hardworking and diligent and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving, often getting first-class grades for his work. Yet, no matter how well John achieved, he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures, and in meetings with me, he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down. John's justification was quite simple: How could he be a success when he was trying so much harder than other people just to attain the same outcomes? See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic, was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness to himself and to others. Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism as a way of being in the world. Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks. It's not about striving for excellence. John's case highlights this vividly. At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self. Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self. And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling. And we think to ourselves, ""Once I've reached that summit, then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."" But what perfectionism doesn't tell us is that soon after reaching that summit, we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame, just to try and scale that peak again. This is the cycle of self-defeat. In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off. And it's why it's so difficult to treat. Now, we've known for decades and decades that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems, but there was never a good way to measure it. That was until the late 1980s when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism. So that's right, folks, you can measure this, and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism. The first is self-oriented perfectionism, the irrational desire to be perfect: ""I strive to be as perfect as I can be."" The second is socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding: ""I feel that others are too demanding of me."" And the third is other-oriented perfectionism, the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people: ""If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."" Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism associate with compromised mental health, including things like heightened depression, heightened anxiety and suicide ideation. But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism is socially prescribed perfectionism. That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect. This element of perfectionism has a large correlation with serious mental illness. And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind, I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing. To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations, but we wanted to look at it at a broader level. So we took all of the data that had ever been collected in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure, and we isolated the data in college students. This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people from American, Canadian and British colleges, and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend. And in all, it took us more than three years to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers, and write our report. But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming. All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time. But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far. In 1989, just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations. By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent. And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested indicate that almost one in three young people will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. Remember, this is the element of perfectionism that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness, and that's for good reason. Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need to meet the expectations of other people. And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection, they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree because these folks believe that the better they do, the better that they're expected to do. This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness. But is there hope? Of course there's hope. Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things -- they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking. And yes, treatment is complex. But a little bit of self-compassion, going easy on ourselves when things don't go well, can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success. And then there's what we can do as caregivers. Perfectionism develops in our formative years, and so young people are more vulnerable. Parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed. And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent, as a lot of anxiety is communicated when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own. But ultimately, our research raises important questions about how we are structuring society and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing is benefiting young people. It's become commonplace for public figures to say that young people just need a little bit more resilience in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures. But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue because we have a shared responsibility to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection in the first place. Let's not kid ourselves. Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge, and for a generation of young people that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight of metrics, lead tables and social media, perfectionism is inevitable, so long as they lack any purpose in life greater than how they are appearing or how they are performing to other people. What can they do about it? Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop, they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again. The ancient Greeks knew that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain is not the road to happiness. Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill, only to see it roll back down and have to start again. So long as we teach young people that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives than this hopeless quest for perfection, then we are going to condemn future generations to that same futility and despair. And so we're left with a question. When are we going to appreciate that there is something fundamentally inhuman about limitless perfection? No one is flawless. If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism, then we will teach them that in a chaotic world, life will often defeat us, but that's OK. Failure is not weakness. If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare of impossible perfection, then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion. But most of all, if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional and psychological health, then we will invite them to celebrate the joys and the beauties of imperfection as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Please, stand up. If you're able. Thank you. I want you to feel like I felt, when I was getting sentenced. It's August 17, 2012. I’m handcuffed and standing for four long hours while the judge is reading my sentence. You're in a small cage and you're surrounded by 10 prison guards in balaclavas. There is also a guard dog who is barking at you angrily because the dog is trained to be suspicious towards people who smell like prison. Even a nice little doge is angry at me. I'm stripped down from my humanity. I'm reduced to being just a prisoner. I'm 22 and I smell like prison. The prosecutor asked for three years in jail for me. My crime is considered to be severe, and it means that the judge can give me up to seven years in jail. And as I'm standing here handcuffed behind the bars, I’m thinking to myself: Can one person change the world? Is it even worth trying? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Will I be able to achieve my dreams or I'm going to be inevitably smashed by the system? I ran away from home when I was 16 years old. I jumped on a plane, went from Siberia to Moscow. I was 16 and I was a dreamer. And I knew that I want two things in life. I want to be able to dream wildly and to be able to make my utopian dreams come true. For that, I knew I needed to be in Moscow. I was studying philosophy and I was stealing food and clothes in order to survive. When I turned 22, I got arrested for resisting to one of the most dangerous dictators on planet Earth. At the day of my arrest, my daughter turned four. You can sit down if you want. What is my crime exactly? I sang a song. ""Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin."" Me and four other members of Pussy Riot came to Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and we preached to the people of Russia from the holy place that for thousands of years was reserved only for the male preachers and, in particular, for the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, who today sends Russians to kill and to die in Ukraine. We sang our song on February 21 of 2012. We did it in response to Putin's announcement that he wants to rule Russia pretty much indefinitely. I dropped everything I was doing, and I promised to myself that I'm going to dedicate my life to resistance. I felt deep inside me that Putin equals death, medieval torture, knife in the back, stagnation, new Dark Ages for Russia. To resist, we used our loud voices, bright ski masks, dresses, courage, commitment and performance art. We would show up in public places, unannounced, guerrilla style. No permits at all. And perform, preach. We performed in government buildings, squares, shopping malls, and we would get arrested almost every single day, get out and go back to action. Our job was to show the people of Russia that resisting is indeed an option. The supreme, sacred, holy rule in Putin's Russia is to remain afraid. We decided to break this rule. By breaking this rule, we disrupted the game as such. We exposed it as a mere game. We said that the emperor is naked. Did we achieve what we wanted? As I'm standing behind the bars, handcuffed, I'm asking myself this question. Yes and no. As I said in my closing statement, we are behind the prison bars, but we are freer than people who are prosecuting us because we can say whatever we want to say and they can say only things that the government censorship allows them to say. Despite of the global movement in support of Pussy Riot, we got convicted to two years in jail. The hell was in front of me. I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona. It's unique in Russia, free of censorship, [an] independent media outlet. In 2022, we raised seven million dollars in two days for Ukraine. When reproductive rights became under attack in the United States, we raised close to one million dollars for Planned Parenthood. We started Unicorn DAO and raised two million dollars to collect art made by women and non-binary people. I really wish I could tell all of this to a 22-year-old version of myself that is standing behind the bars, separated from her family, not knowing what's going to happen next. Much work remains to be done. My friends and family are getting beaten, imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and murdered back home. In March 2023, I was put on Russia's most-wanted list. I'm facing new criminal charges for the art I made. Why? Because I said that the emperor is naked and because he is, in fact, naked, he's scared of it. We shattered the world of appearances and we said that living a lie is indeed living a lie. And it's dangerous for any dictatorship. The reason why I became a threat to the system, not because of any actual physical power that I have, but because courage is contagious. And any act of speaking the truth can cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness. And we all have this power. It's a moral act to use this power. You may or may not achieve the results that you wanted, but there is eternal beauty in trying to find truth, in risking everything you've got for what's right, stop calculating your profit and just taking a leap of faith. Courage is an ability to act in the face of fear. And some of us have chosen to live courageously. For some of us, it's not a choice. It's a matter of survival, like for our Ukrainian friends. Vladimir Putin became intimidated by Ukraine choosing the path of freedom and democracy. That's why the Russian army bombs maternity wards, schools, hospitals, rapes and kills civilians and throws their bodies in mass graves. Putin and everyone who supports him are dead inside and they must be defeated. And while I'm standing here, I want to send a message to Vladimir Putin directly. A wanted criminal to wanted criminal. Vladimir Vladimirovich, the Kremlin walls became your prison walls. You have already lost. You know it. That's why you're so afraid. You lost in spirit. The world is on Ukraine's side.

(Applause) And she's not going to forgive your crimes against humanity. Yesterday, my friend, my colleague and comrade Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail for publicly condemning the war in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's regime.

Please, stand up. If you're able. Thank you. I want you to feel like I felt, when I was getting sentenced. It's August 17, 2012. I’m handcuffed and standing for four long hours while the judge is reading my sentence. You're in a small cage and you're surrounded by 10 prison guards in balaclavas. There is also a guard dog who is barking at you angrily because the dog is trained to be suspicious towards people who smell like prison. Even a nice little doge is angry at me. I'm stripped down from my humanity. I'm reduced to being just a prisoner. I'm 22 and I smell like prison. The prosecutor asked for three years in jail for me. My crime is considered to be severe, and it means that the judge can give me up to seven years in jail. And as I'm standing here handcuffed behind the bars, I’m thinking to myself: Can one person change the world? Is it even worth trying? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Will I be able to achieve my dreams or I'm going to be inevitably smashed by the system? I ran away from home when I was 16 years old. I jumped on a plane, went from Siberia to Moscow. I was 16 and I was a dreamer. And I knew that I want two things in life. I want to be able to dream wildly and to be able to make my utopian dreams come true. For that, I knew I needed to be in Moscow. I was studying philosophy and I was stealing food and clothes in order to survive. When I turned 22, I got arrested for resisting to one of the most dangerous dictators on planet Earth. At the day of my arrest, my daughter turned four. You can sit down if you want. What is my crime exactly? I sang a song. ""Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin."" Me and four other members of Pussy Riot came to Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and we preached to the people of Russia from the holy place that for thousands of years was reserved only for the male preachers and, in particular, for the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, who today sends Russians to kill and to die in Ukraine. We sang our song on February 21 of 2012. We did it in response to Putin's announcement that he wants to rule Russia pretty much indefinitely. I dropped everything I was doing, and I promised to myself that I'm going to dedicate my life to resistance. I felt deep inside me that Putin equals death, medieval torture, knife in the back, stagnation, new Dark Ages for Russia. To resist, we used our loud voices, bright ski masks, dresses, courage, commitment and performance art. We would show up in public places, unannounced, guerrilla style. No permits at all. And perform, preach. We performed in government buildings, squares, shopping malls, and we would get arrested almost every single day, get out and go back to action. Our job was to show the people of Russia that resisting is indeed an option. The supreme, sacred, holy rule in Putin's Russia is to remain afraid. We decided to break this rule. By breaking this rule, we disrupted the game as such. We exposed it as a mere game. We said that the emperor is naked. Did we achieve what we wanted? As I'm standing behind the bars, handcuffed, I'm asking myself this question. Yes and no. As I said in my closing statement, we are behind the prison bars, but we are freer than people who are prosecuting us because we can say whatever we want to say and they can say only things that the government censorship allows them to say. Despite of the global movement in support of Pussy Riot, we got convicted to two years in jail. The hell was in front of me. I was forced to sew police and military uniforms and I was getting injured while I was doing it. But even in the darkest moments, I knew that our fight is not over. Two years later, I will get out of jail. And I will meet thousands of young Russians who will tell me that they got inspired by our fight. Over the next ten years, Pussy Riot will build infrastructure, tools and network for effective resistance. In 2014, we started Mediazona.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical. So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do ""research"" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research. (Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone. (Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks? So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you. Thank you very much. (Applause)",Shape-shifting tech will change work as we know it,"user:

You see, while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity, it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved, and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with 3D printing, and it all started with this, the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who invented 3D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today, the big idea that I want to discuss with you, is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future, but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage, and it's going to usher in a new era of localized, distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples? Anybody? Wouldn't it be awesome if you could, for the first time, get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly, so chances are, the hinges are not going to break? But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time, she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down, but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics, but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine, a little bit more elegant, and lightweight, and like good tailors, we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said, it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what? She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right? And their customers and the environment. But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources, a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship, it costs a fraction of its cost, and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts, and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone, the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional, usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. How about food? What if we could, for the first time, make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here, that are edible? What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed? And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste, which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner? And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics, perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me, will we have a 3D printer in every home? I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, how will 3D printing change my life? Or, in other words, what room in my house will 3D printing fit in? So everything that you see here has been 3D printed, including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-local manufacturing. My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl, and my father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized 3D printed shoes. He passed away three years ago. But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all, is right here in the house today, and thanks to him, I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say that I am a cobbler too, and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the future. Thank you. (Applause)",What's next in 3D printing,"user:

 ${text}",[[]],0,"Joseph Keller used to jog around the Stanford campus, and he was struck by all the women jogging there as well. Why did their ponytails swing from side to side like that? Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why. (Laughter) Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle. Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. I read about him in the New York Times, in the obituaries. The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature. I read the obituaries almost every day. My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a ""Let's see who died today."" (Laughter) But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures. An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries. In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data -- a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. And we began to think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times? Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured -- even if you aren't around to enjoy it? (Laughter) Would this go better with scrambled eggs? (Laughter) And so, we looked at the data. 2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016. What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us? Well, first we looked at words. This here is an obituary headline. This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew. If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime. Just looking at these is fascinating. Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years. Try and guess who they are. [An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince. [Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century] Oh, yes. [Muhammad Ali] [Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha Hadid. So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing, where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words -- ""the,"" ""and,"" -- the kind of words you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" -- and leaves you with the most significant words. And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors. And this is what it looks like. Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful. And while we're talking profession, let's look at age -- the average age at which they achieved things. That number is 37. What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for -- on average -- 44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 -- on average. (Laughter) Talk about having to be patient. (Laughter) Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s. And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of politics. (Laughter) Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s. (Laughter) If you're wondering what ""others"" are, here are some examples. Isn't it fascinating, the things people do and the things they're remembered for? (Laughter) Our curiosity was in overdrive, and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor. So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous. Famous people -- Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid -- people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly. I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names. Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous. So what if we analyze these two groups separately -- the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell us? Take a look. Two things leap out at me. First: ""John."" (Laughter) Anyone here named John should thank your parents -- (Laughter) and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone. And second: ""help."" We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print could teach us. The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life, and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things. They made a positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped. So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society? Because the most powerful lesson here is, if more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death, the world would be a much better place. Thank you.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"" and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)","Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality","user:
suggest three insightful, concise subheadings which summarize this text, suggest three bullet points for each subheading:
What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core.

 ${text}",[[]],0,"About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort. In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so, when you fly down -- (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model. Now, I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- (Laughter) But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening. (Laughter) OK. (Ringing) All right, guys, are you there? (Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. (Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. (Laughter) We're doing two different -- OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... (Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. (Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. (Applause)",Augmented-reality maps,"user:

When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. (Applause) This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. (Applause)

 ${text}",[[]],0,"You may know this feeling: you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone. Your calendar is already packed with meetings, sometimes double- or triple-booked. You feel engaged, you feel busy. In fact, you feel productive. But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. You try to figure out what it is. But before you do, the next day starts all over again. That was how I felt two years ago. I felt stressed; I felt anxious. I felt a bit trapped. The world around me was moving very quickly. And I didn't know what to do. I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? I started looking for answers. I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. I even read many self-help books. But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. (Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. (Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. ""The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."" This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. It only had 81 pages. And each page had a short poem. I remember I flipped to one particular poem. Here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Let me read it out to you. ""The supreme goodness is like water. It benefits all things without contention. In dwelling, it stays grounded. In being, it flows to depths. In expression, it is honest. In confrontation, it stays gentle. In governance, it does not control. In action, it aligns to timing. It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted."" Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. I felt the biggest chills down my spine. I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. The first lesson is about humility. If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. It is humble. But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. Water's humility taught me a few important things. It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, ""I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help."" It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. Humility gives water its power. But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. The second lesson I learned is about harmony. If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. In the end, nothing did. And I got more frustrated. By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? Does this align with my nature? I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. Nature does not hurry. Yet, everything is accomplished. That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. Water is open to change. Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. We also live in a world today of constant change. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. Life is like a hackathon in some way. It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: ""I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience."" (Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. It can only be an amazing experience. So humility, harmony and openness. Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. (Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? (Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. Try it, and let me know how it works for you. I would love to hear from you. Thank you. (Applause)",Be humble -- and other lessons from the philosophy of water,"user:
