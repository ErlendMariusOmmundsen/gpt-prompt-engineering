The massive machines removing carbon from Earth's atmosphere,Technology,Jan Wurzbacher,"To restrain global warming, we know we need to drastically reduce pollution. The very next step after that: using both natural and technological solutions to trap as much excess carbon dioxide from the air as possible. Enter Orca, the world's first large-scale direct air capture and storage plant, built in Iceland by the team at Climeworks, led by climate entrepreneur Jan Wurzbacher. This plant is capable of removing 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year. With affordability and scalability in mind, Wurzbacher shares his vision for what comes after Orca, the future of carbon removal tech -- and why these innovations are crucial to stop climate change.","Well today I'm really glad to get to share something with you that I've been working on for the past 15 years. But more importantly, something that could become the first specimen of an entire new industry that we might find all around the planet over the next decades. Think of it as something like the very first smartphone. Still quite clumsy and quite expensive, but of transformative technology. Smartphones have changed the way how we communicate. This, I hope, could change the way we deal with global warming. This is Orca. This is the first worldwide commercial direct air capture and storage plant. It is in Iceland, and it is an industrial plant that extracts CO2 out of ambient air. We have operated now for more than one year. It costs more than 10 million dollars to build Orca. And its modules, those eight boxes that we call CO2 collectors, they are designed to extract a bit more than 10 tons of carbon dioxide from the air every day. It sounds quite expensive. However, when thinking about cost, we should keep in mind one thing. There is one thing that we cannot buy, and that is time. And we need to be quite fast here. So that is why Orca is not there to demonstrate costs. Orca is there to show in the field, out there, in the weather, that the plant is operating, and Orca is working. So the next step for us at Climeworks and for all the other companies in the field is now going forward, improving the technology, scaling it up from tens to hundreds to millions of tons capacity. And as we go ahead and we scale it up, with every new plant going online, we'll have efficiencies going up and we'll have costs going down. Now, how does it work? In the case of Orca, we have fans mounted to the CO2 collectors that draw air through them. Inside there is a filter material that we call sorbent, a highly porous material. And as the air pulls through it, the CO2 is bound at the surface of this material. Think of it as a sponge that sucks up water in its pores. We do that for a certain time until the material is filled with used CO2, it is saturated. And we close the modules, we heat them up to around 100 degrees Celsius, and we can extract concentrated CO2 from them. The good thing is that the main energy input that we need for that process is low temperature heat at around 100 degrees Celsius. And it can entirely be powered by renewable energy. Now that looks quite easy at first glance, right? And indeed, the process behind that is quite simple. However, when it comes to implementing that into reality in the field out there with the purpose of having a plant that is constantly operating, 24/7, reliably, then it becomes quite challenging. Let me give you two examples why it is a challenge to capture and remove CO2 from the air. First of all, there is not a lot of CO2 in the air. We're currently at around 420 ppm. That means one molecule out of 2,500 molecules in the air around us is CO2. That's not a lot. And that means to extract only one ton of CO2 from the air, we need to filter around two million cubic meters of air. That's about 800 Olympic swimming pools. And there's another way of picturing that, which I personally find quite puzzling. Imagine one of these filters with an inlet area of one meter by one meter. And the amount of air, like, think of it as a block of air that you have to push through that filter inlet to take just one ton of CO2 out of the air, is 2,000 kilometers long. Another example why this is a challenge is that it is not so easy to find good, actually, the best sorbent materials, which are both high-performing and which can prevail outside there in the field with a long life. Now, in this next picture, you see Christoph and myself, cofounders of Climeworks, in the very early days of Climeworks, working on that. The very first sorbents, we produced them with our own hands, such as you would do your laundry if you didn't have a washing machine. We set some sorbents on fire, and we produced hundreds of samples in the past 10 years. Looking forward, thousands of more will come, very likely. Now, this is one way of doing it. We are doing that in our company, but many others are doing it. There are companies out there, start-ups, more established companies and researchers and scientists. And that is a good thing because the challenge ahead of us is immense. Now let's step back and look at the big picture. So where does this kind of technology fit into our overall fight against climate change? And it's important that first and foremost, the most important thing we need to do is, and will always stay, the drastic reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases. Without that, we will have no chance of ever meeting any of our climate goals. Then in a second step, it will be important that we can all ramp up the capacity of extracting and removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Now, when thinking about the latter, so far I've spoken about technology, but we shouldn't forget that also, nature offers several solutions to extract carbon from the air, such as forests and oceans. And one element that is very important will be doubling down on these methods offered by nature, enhancing them and protecting them. That is important. However, will it be sufficient to rely only on nature-based carbon sinks? Very likely not. Trees need time to grow and forests need space, and there is simply just not enough area available to plant entire continents of new forests, which we would need in order to capture many billions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. And therefore, besides preserving all these nature-based solutions and enhancing them, it will be very important to scale up technology-based solutions for large-scale carbon removal from the atmosphere. Now, I often get asked if you build direct air capture plants like the one we saw before, is that a license to continue polluting? It is clearly not. Direct air capture is not a silver bullet, but it is a must-have. Had we stopped emitting 20, 30 years ago, or at least substantially reduced our emissions, Climeworks and this whole emerging industry around us would likely not be here today. And for the climate, that would probably be the better solution. However, that's not where we are today. Today, the IPCC has indicated in their last report that technology-based solutions to remove carbon from the air are a necessity, and they included it [in] their models. And that is why this entire industry that is currently emerging now needs to double down on moving from small-scale and relatively expensive to larger-scale and cheap. Double down on developing, deploying, learning and adjusting in the field. We have to develop markets, we have to develop policy. And we have to develop mechanisms to analyze the CO2 capture and other technical ways of removing CO2 that take care of the fact that by taking CO2 out of the air with machines and putting it down in the ground we have one of the most permanent ways of storing the CO2 away for millions of years. Now let’s get back one step, and let’s get back to today where we are. And let’s get back to the present, to what is concrete. Let's get back to Iceland and our Orca plant. I've told you before how these collectors extract CO2 from the air. Now, how do we make sure that it really permanently stays locked away? For that reason, in Iceland, we have partnered up with a company Carbfix and have developed a method for permanent carbon storage through mineralization. What they do is they take the CO2, mix it with water, and inject it into underground volcanic, so-called basalt rock formations. That is one of the most abundant stone or stone material that you find on Earth. And by doing so, the CO2 binds with the rock, it mineralizes, and it literally turns into stone within two years, hundreds of meters underground. The good thing about that method is that it is very tangible, and it's very easy to understand. And for that purpose, I've brought this rock sample here for you. That is taken actually from a drill core of a basalt rock formation hundreds of meters underground. And what you can see here, that's a black rock, which is the black basalt rock, containing some white crystals. And these crystals are CO2 turned into stone underground and locked away. (Applause) Now I explained to you one method of doing this. There are several other methods out there. There are several other techniques, other technologies. But the important thing about it is that this thing is out there. It's in practice, it's operating, and we are learning from it. And that is so essential for this new industry. And we have learned a lot, actually. We have learned how to operate on hot, dry summer days. We learned to operate them in pouring rain. And we even had to learn how to operate them on a just normal day. We had to learn how to ramp up the Orca plant immediately after an Icelandic snowstorm. And this all is what we need in order to deploy these plants all over the world. We should deploy them all over the world because we do need so many of them. We can deploy them all over the world because the air is everywhere around us and the CO2 is almost the same concentration everywhere where we are. So it doesn't matter where we capture the CO2. And for that reason, and in the spirit of deploying more, in June of this year we have announced the next step on our Climeworks scale-up road map, which is named Mammoth, and that is what you see here. That is a plant which is nine times larger than the Orca plant, that will be in Iceland as well. And the first tons of CO2 will be captured by the end of 2023. This winter, we will finalize the first building before the snow starts. Now there is a big challenge ahead of us. And actually, you can only really understand what this challenge is and really quantify it if you build these things out there, make mistakes and learn from them. So it's a hard problem. It's not a simple problem to solve, and there is no easy solution to it. And without action like this, there is no solution at all. And so when I started looking back at the last 15 years, what we have been doing, I'm now looking forward to the next 15 years that are to come because that is what we need. Thank you. (Applause)",PT11M59S,2023-02-21T15:47:40Z
What if buildings created energy instead of consuming it?,Technology,Ksenia Petrichenko,"Buildings are bad news for the climate -- but they don't have to be. While our structures are currently responsible for a third of global energy consumption and emissions, a future where they create more energy than they consume is possible. Energy policy analyst Ksenia Petrichenko has a three-tiered strategy for thinking differently about buildings, transforming them from passive users to active players in the energy system and bringing us closer to our climate targets.","Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don’t often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

Could fungi actually be the key to humanity's survival?,Technology,David Andrew Quist,"After a billion years of evolution, fungi are masters of invention and resilience. What wisdom can we draw from their long, remarkable existence? Mycologist David Andrew Quist explores how fungi's innate biointelligence, penchant for collaboration and incredible regeneration abilities can show us new ways to think about complex problems -- and may hold the secret to humanity's survival on Earth.","OK, people, let's just get this out of the way. Now, I know this isn't a very comfortable subject for many of you, but I've got to say it. We have to talk about your fungus problem. Now, it's OK, don't be embarrassed. You know who you are. We can work this out. We'll get through it together. Now, call them fungi, ""fun-gee,"" ""fun-guy"" -- you decide. But what I'd like to impress upon you is this is a new world we need to begin exploring. And I think we can do it in interesting ways. But all of us have had an issue with fungi at some point in our lives, right? Maybe even now? We think of fungi, we think of fuzzy stuff that's growing on our yogurt that we forgot in the back of the fridge. Or maybe that itch you developed by wearing that favorite pair of pants, but just got a little bit too tight? Or, you know, maybe you think of death and decay and disease, when you think about fungi? But fungi, maybe some of them have a dark side. I mean, who of us doesn't? But I'd like to invite you to see these misunderstood creatures in a new light, and maybe start to appreciate some of the positive and inspirational ways that they behave. So if that mold is breaking bad on that yogurt you forgot in the back of the fridge, again, maybe it's not just rotting and spoiling, but maybe it's taking an act of transformation, of renewal and of new possibilities. And it's that very act of transformation that's so central to life on our planet, it’s been important for our own history. And maybe for the future, if we can learn from fungi, we might be able to transform ourselves and our societies in ways that are in greater harmony with nature. So what do I mean when I say fungi have been important to our past? I'm not talking about that amazing mushroom trip you took back in university, though that was probably pretty awesome in its own right. What I'm talking about is the way that fungi have been central to the evolution of life on the planet, that virtually all life has a fungal backstory. Now, think: fungi have been on the planet for a billion years ... or more. And during that time the Earth was just a rocky, desolate place. There wasn't a lot of life on it. Now, algae would actually escape the waters and come onto land to evolve into land plants, but only by partnering with fungi first, as its root system. Soils would begin to form as fungi ate rock and broke it down to make the nutrients available. So you had this opportunity for new life to spring up. As a result, the evolution of plants would explode across the planet, which would oxygenate the atmosphere and allow the evolution of more complex life-forms, like us, humans. Right? So being on the planet for a billion years, fungi have developed all sorts of life strategies to be adaptive and diverse and resilient. Think about it -- they survived a billion years, through great swings in climate, over hundreds of millions of years, lived through all the five great mass extinction events, where the dinosaurs went extinct and the poor little trilobites and countless other forms of life that we don't even know existed. But fungi persisted and thrived, and do to this day. And I think that's what drove them to me. It's so endearing, right? I mean, who doesn't love a good survival story? I know I do. But fungi weren't my first love. That was music, actually. And actually, when I was a young, young boy, I was really into grunge music, and I played in a grunge band. And we were awful. (Laughter) But I didn't know that at the time, and anyhow, I had to follow my passion. So I put everything in my pickup truck and I moved from my childhood home of Kansas City to Seattle, the mecca of grunge music in the ’90s. And I was going to start a new band. And unfortunately, none of the talent of Nirvana or Soundgarden rubbed off on me. It would have been a quite different life had it did. But the splendor of the Pacific Northwest forests really did. And it was the trees and all the life aboveground that drew me there, but it was the fungi and the microbes belowground that kept me coming back. I just got even more and more interested about the way that they lived, all these bizarre forms, the fact that fungi are literally everywhere. Right now, they're on your skin, in your gut. With every breath you take, you inhale dozens of fungal spores. Every move you make, you trample mushrooms and molds beneath your feet, in the soil. And their ubiquity ... is a big reason why we know so little about fungi. Despite all the tools we have at our disposal, scientific tools, we know perhaps five percent of all the fungi, some three million species that are thought to exist in the world today. Now that's a massive amount of biodiversity that we know virtually nothing about, how it lives and what it does. And that's what really inspired me to continue to study about fungi and ask deeper questions. Could some of this biodiversity help in creating a more resilient future? What could we actually learn from fungi? Were there metaphors that we might apply to how we live, to create a more resilient future together? I'd like to share with you some of those metaphors. The first is that fungi are biointelligent. Being on the planet for so long, fungi have created a really great ability to be good at resource efficiency and resilience, and, as it turns out, spatial planning. So researchers in Japan did this super cool experiment where they wanted to see if fungi could help engineers to create more efficient transport networks. So they laid out oatmeal on a petri dish, corresponding to the cities of the Tokyo metropolitan area. And they introduced a slime mold, a type of fungus whose favoritest food ever is oatmeal, and the fungus rapidly went through a process of self-optimization to find the most efficient links between its favoritest-ever food source, represented by a map of the Tokyo metropolitan area. And in a matter of hours, it would recreate, largely, the existing railway map of the Tokyo metropolitan area -- a process it took engineers decades to actually produce. Now the fungus, it has no brain, it has no plan, it was given no instructions or guidance. But still, it created a highly optimized network. And this convinced me and other scientists that maybe fungi could have practical applications to help solve some of our human challenges in ways that are quick and efficient and perhaps even more imaginative than we could do with all of our brains put together. Now, another way that fungi can produce a metaphor is being collaborative. Now, there is most evidence in their relationship with plants. Now remember how algae evolved into plants through the help of fungi as their root system? Well, that love affair never ended. Still today, 90 percent of all land plants need to have a mycorrhizal association. This is the plant-fungus-root association. So depicted here, in this highly realistic view of the underground of a forest ecosystem ... you can see the fungus, which exists in most of its life as thin filaments, and the network of thin filaments, we call it mycelium. And the mycelium of the fungus can tap into the root of plants and make a symbiosis. And thereby, they exchange nutrients that the other one isn't so good at making or capturing. So in case of the fungi, they're providing minerals to the plants, and the plants, through photosynthesis, are providing carbon. And so this exchange can go on between the organisms. But it doesn’t stop there, because the fungi can tap into other plants at the same time, and other plants can also have other fungal partners. So what you end up with is this massive underground network mediated by fungi. Now, it's not just nutrients that are flowing, but also communication, because plants can talk to each other through the fungal network to create chemical signals to be able to warn of a pest attack, for example. Now, fungi are also regenerative. Now, their ability to decompose is important for the planet, to say the least, because fungi eat death and give it back to life, as nutrients, to start the cycle anew. In nature, there's no such thing as waste. I mean, waste is a human concept. Everything is used, everything is circular. Everything becomes something else. And if you don't appreciate fungi, you will, for one reason, and it's that decompositional ability. I mean, think about it. We would be buried under kilometers of undecayed plant matter and dead animals and poo without the decompositional ability of fungi. And that would be a pretty crappy existence, you've got to admit. So as a metaphor, fungi can provide us with ways of being biointelligent, collaborative and resilient. But I also believe that fungi have practical applications in how we produce materials. And this is actually my very cool day job, as researcher at a fermentation science company here in Oslo that’s reimagining a new world of more sustainable materials of everyday products. So let me give you some examples. One is biomaterials. So taking a fungus, we can literally grow new materials, using agricultural residues, to replace unsustainable products like Styrofoam or Rockwool that often end up in landfills or in pollution. So we can grow things like soundproofing panels or insulation for buildings. Or we can make mushroom Frisbees. The possibilities are nearly endless. We can also make textiles from fungi. So, for example, animal-free leathers. So usually, you have a cow, and it takes about three years to make leather, and all the resources and animal death that is involved. Not a great way to make leather. If you can make it another way, like with fungi, it takes days to make it. A much better way that's both efficient and ethical, and how we can make leathers in the future. And then, there's food, a subject I'm particularly passionate about. Now, with fungi, we can make a whole range of sustainable and delicious foods. Things like meat replacements for seafood or dairy, for example. Or even a new class of food that doesn't look like any of that stuff. The possibilities are unlimited. And we can do it in a way that has a fraction of the environmental footprint. Now fungi are self-replicating organisms, so we can make it in really huge quantities, and help address the challenge of how we're going to make more food and lower our impact on the planet. It's a big challenge. We can do it with fungi. And last but not least, fish feed. I mean, here we are in Norway, right? The world's largest producer of salmon. And what do we feed that salmon, as proteins? Two things, primarily -- soy and fish meal, neither of which are sustainable sources of protein for the future, because they contribute to overfishing in the oceans and land-use patterns that degrade, for some of the lands. So we need to come up with more sustainable sources in how we feed our fish. And what if we could do it using fungi to create the proteins to feed those fish? And we could do it in a way that we’re using byproducts of food industries as food for our fungus when we grew it? It would be an amazingly sustainable system and, dare I say it, it would help in our self-sufficiency. Now, one of the coolest things about being a fungal researcher is, with all that diversity out there, probably the coolest thing that fungi can do, we haven't even uncovered yet. The most amazing fungal discoveries are still waiting to be made. We're only scratching the surface of what we might be able to achieve with the help of fungi. So I have a hope, and my hope is that we transfer our fungal problems into fungal solutions, that we look to the fungal world for new mindsets and new metaphors and even new materials, as we think more collaboratively, regeneratively and with more biointelligence, as we approach the future, just like fungi. Thank you very much. (Applause)",PT14M29S,2023-02-03T16:10:07Z
"7 new species of robot that jump, dance — and walk on water",Technology,Dennis Hong,"More than a decade ago, roboticist Dennis Hong debuted a new generation of cutting-edge robots. Now he's back to reveal how his lab at UCLA has eclipsed its own achievements with a fleet of wildly advanced and delightful humanoid robots. Part demo, part time capsule, part glance into the future, Hong brings you into the excitement and potential of the next evolution in robotics engineering.","Exactly 12 years ago in a TEDx Talk, I introduced my seven species of robot. A unique three-legged robot called STriDER, a wheel-leg hybrid robot called IMPASS, an amoeba robot and many more. Now, 12 years is a pretty long time, especially in a cutting-edge field like robotics. How have our robots evolved during the past 12 years? What new species of robot have we built since then? Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and today, I would like to show you our next seven species of robot. Since my last TEDx Talk, we’ve been focusing on the development of humanoid robots: robots that look like us, two legs, torso, two arms and a head. Let me show you some of the humanoid robots that we developed at our lab, RoMeLa. DARwIn is a miniature humanoid robot for research and education that we made fully open-source. (Laughter) CHARLI is considered the United States’ very first full-sized humanoid robot. THOR-RD is for disaster relief applications and Shipboard Autonomous Fire fighting Robot, SAFFiR and THOR, which uses this unique biologically-inspired actuator. And many more. I think we built more than a dozen different types of humanoid  robots. However, after more than a decade of humanoid robotics research, I'm starting to have different thoughts. Now humanoid robots are important and they're great. However, they always fall down, they’re too unstable. And they’re painfully slow. Yes, these days we’re trying to develop technology that resolves these two problems, but still, they are too expensive and they’re too complicated. And most importantly, they’re too dangerous. You do not want to be next to these big, heavy moving robots. It might fall on top of you. So what do we do? (Laughter) Now, why is it so difficult to make robots walk with two feet? I mean, we do it all the time. So once I wanted to throw away everything I know about robotics for a moment and try to think fundamentally, why is it so difficult to make robots walk with two feet? And I found something fascinating. So check this out. Now, when your robot tries to move forward, one of the reasons why it constantly falls down is because the distance between your left and right leg. Because your legs move forward and backward, up and down, it creates this unwanted twisting forces, we call these moments, right? Now, this is a video called a RoboOne Competition. It's a robot fighting competition. And people who participate in this competition are robot hobbyists. And if you look at the robots, they develop, it’s brilliant. It's fast, it's nimble, and it doesn't fall down. And if you look carefully, they always walk sideways, Because if you walk sideways, your left and right leg line up, so your twisting moments disappear. I actually got this inspiration by watching sports, fencing or ballet. They always walk sideways, and I think this is the reason why. Now, one of the problems of trying to make robots move sideways is you cannot really use your knees. So what do we do? We rotate our legs. It looks kind of awkward, right? So actually, let's change the entire torso like this and make it walk this way. Now, the problem of this kind of configuration is that you really cannot use your feet and ankles. So what do we do? We get rid of them. Now let's make more changes, let's change the shin. And while doing that, let's change the head. And something strange starts to emerge. This is NABi, Non Anthropomorphic Biped. In other words, it's a robot with two legs, but it does not look like a human. How does it walk? It walks like this. Simple, fast, easy, low cost. This is great. Now, I briefly mentioned about a robot called SAFFiR, Shipboard Autonomous Fire Fighting Robot that we built. This is a robot for Navy ships. And I don't know if you've been on a Navy ship, but if you open this door, it has a really high door seal. We call that “knee-knockers.” Before we had this robot, it was very difficult for the robot to climb over it. But if a robot does not have to be like a human, we can do something like this. Make the knee rotate at 360 degrees. Brilliant! Isn't this cool? (Laughs) Yeah. Our robots can climb stairs, but it's rather difficult. But now we can climb stairs like this. Now, is this just simulation and animation? No. In two weeks, from the idea, analysis, design and fabrication, in two weeks, we built our first robot. And you have not seen anything like this. (Video) Man: You're wild. And we use many different types of tricks. For example, utilize the springiness of the feet we can store the energy and make it hop and jump. When we first introduced NABi to the community, it had a pretty good impact on the community. However, this robot is great for walking forward and backward. But how does it change directions? It can't. So we decided to work on the next version called ALPHRED. ALPHRED stands for Autonomous Leg Personal Helper Robot with Enhanced Dynamics. So think of this robot as two NABis stacked onto each other. So it looks like this. So this robot is axisymmetric, which means that there's no forwards, backwards or sideways. Now, when it walks, it has a very wide stance, right? So it can walk like this. And this is great for unstructured outdoor environments. However, it's pretty slow. If you want to make it go really fast, you can change your body configuration. And if you go like this, you can have your forward legs and backward legs, and then you can gallop like a horse. There you go. (Laughs) And when you lift two of the arms it can walk like NABi, then the two of the other legs can be used as arms to pick up boxes or press buttons. And we're pretty excited about this new type of configuration. We call this multimodal locomotion, and this is ALPHRED. Now, while developing these robots, we've been also working on this new type of actuator. Now, when we say actuators, we're talking about these devices that make the robots move just like muscles in humans. Now, most of the robots that exist today, electric robots, use electric motors with gears, right? And these are really strong, and they're precise, they're good for manufacturing. But for legs, we need something different. We need something like biological muscles that's compliant, springy, and not only the position, but also change the force. And we developed a new type of actuator called the BEAR actuator. Now, using this BEAR actuator with the NABi, we developed a second version called NABi-2. Now, if you remember, NABi was our experiment for studying a new type of bipedal locomotion. But it turns out that this NABi with these new actuators doesn't work very well in terms of walking. However, unexpectedly, we didn't know this, but this robot is great for jumping and hopping. It can jump forward, backward and turn directions, it's brilliant. But the really cool thing is, once it jumps and when it lands, the motors become generators, and the impact is changed to electricity. And it can charge its battery, so it’s very energy efficient. And NABi-2 is ready to go. Or not. (Laughs) But this is NABi-2. So BEAR actuator with NABi was NABi-2, then BEAR actuator with ALPHRED is -- ALPHRED-2. And this is the next generation of ALPHRED. So this is the very first time we turned on the switch. Look carefully at the reaction of our students. (Video) Man: Whoa! Oh, my God! What the -- ? Dennis Hong: Excuse me. (Laughs) (Video) (Man shouts excitedly) Oh, my! Man 2: That was amazing! I think it jumped about 1.4 meters. This is remarkable. Walking is also very fast and stable. So we wanted to do something more interesting. We wanted to make it do taekwondo. (Video) (Men shouting excitedly) Whoa! DH: We're just having too much fun. And ALPHRED-2 is ready to go. Now, ALPHRED-2 is actually a very practical robot. For example, this is an example of picking up a box, delivering it and putting it nicely on the ground or on the table. I sped up the video because it was pretty slow, but you can get an idea how we can use these new type of robots for different applications. And this is ALPHRED-2. Now, we looked at two legs. We looked at four legs. What about six legs? Of course, we have a hexapod robot. Now, this robot, HEX, is about the size of a small car. Now, the cool thing about six-legged robots is this. Now, to have static stability, the minimum number of contacts with the ground is three. Think of a camera tripod. If you have a hexapod robot, you can always have three-point contact with the ground. Three, three, three. And this makes it really great for outdoor environment, rough environment. This particular robot we're developing for demining applications, getting rid of landmines underground autonomously. If you see it in person, it’s kind of scary, it's big and goes like this. (Laughs) So this is HEX. We also have a smaller version, this is called SiLVIA: Six Legged Vehicle with Intelligent Articulation. And as I mentioned, these type of robots are really great for unstructured terrain such as this. It can also climb up and down stairs. And this robot might be the strongest six-legged robot out there. (Video) Man: Ah, 20 kilograms. DH: Now, the reason why we wanted to make it really strong is because we want this robot to do some very interesting new type of stuff. So this is the very first robot that can brace between walls and climb up. So it's like Spiderman, isn't that cool? And it has some other tricks, too. If you put suction cups on the feet, it can stick to the wall and climb. And if you give it an arm, it can do some fun stuff on the blackboard, too. And this is SiLVIA. So we talked about vertical mobility. Twelve years ago, in my last TEDx Talk, I introduced a robot called CLIMBeR. It's a robot for climbing cliffs using cables like a human. But this year, we wanted to get rid of the cable. We wanted to make it do free climbing. And I'm very excited to introduce a brand new robot called SCALER, Spine Enhanced Climbing Autonomous Legged Exploration Robot. Now, when you first look at it, it looks like a quadruped robot, four-legged robot. It's actually very strong, but strength is not all. We had to develop this new type of gripper, we call these spine grippers, that can really grab onto the surfaces. And this video, we just took it a few days ago. So literally, it's taking its very first few steps. Now, why are we interested in cliff-climbing robots? Rescue missions, of course. But we're really interested in the planetary applications. Now, as you know, on Mars, we had these Rovers discovering the new planet. However, the really science-rich sites are always at the cliffs, and these Rovers cannot get there. So something like this will enable those kind of exploration, in the science-rich sites on planetary surfaces. This is SCALER. Now, we talked about legs, but what about wheels? Of course, we have robots with wheels. This is called OmBURo, Omnidirectional Balancing Unicycle Robot. And as the name implies, it has one wheel, it's omnidirectional, it can go forward, backwards, sideways and diagonal. But if we look at it, it doesn’t even need to change its orientation. When you see it, it's almost like magic. It feels like it's gliding over the surface. Isn't that cool? It can also balance and climb very steep surfaces. Now it follows path, now, yes, it has one wheel, but actually has these smaller rollers in the rim to generate this kind of motion as well. So why do we want to build a robot like this? We like to have robots living with us in this environment, and this environment sometimes is crowded, a lot of people or obstacles. To go through people or to avoid obstacles, it's very important to have a very small cross section, and probably a single wheel is the best way to have a very small cross section. And this is OmBURo. Now, I’ve shown you many different shapes, sizes, mechanism robots. And if you remember this, the whole thing started because we had problems with this bipedal locomotion. Is there a way to make these humanoid robots not fall at all? There is. And this robot is called BALLU. This is my son, Ethan, by the way. (Video) Ethan (Clapping and cheering) Man: Uh-oh. DH: What if robots never fell? What if we could change the direction of gravity? I'm very excited to show you our new robot, BALLU, Buoyancy Assisted Lightweight Leg Unit. This robot is a bipedal robot the size of a human being. But the body is a helium balloon. It's a balloon with two legs. How does it walk? It walks like this. Very elegant, isn't it? This robot might be the safest robot out there. It can walk forward, backwards, sideways. It can turn directions. We want this robot to be living with us. So it can climb upstairs, downstairs. Go over obstacles. It's fun to play with. It can hop, now it can hop up to a height of a table top. Oh, this robot is a good dancer. If you turn on the music, it listens to beat and it dances to the beat. (Music) Now we do crazy things when we do experiments. Once, we opened the window and threw the robot out the window. Isn't it great? It solves all the problems of bilateral locomotion. It’s cheap, it doesn’t fall down. However, it also creates new problems. This robot is horrible outdoors because if the wind blows, it floats away. Now, these are some of the images of our secret projects. I'm not going to explain it, but we’re using projection mapping, vortex cannons, many different things. Oh, this robot literally can walk on water. You put ping-pong balls on the foot, it can walk on water. It can also walk on a tightrope. Isn’t this cool? This is BALLU. By the way, all of our videos end with a bang like this. Isn’t that cool? This is BALLU. (Laughs) Thank you. (Applause) Now all of these new inventions and creativity came from the problem of humanoid robots. However, secretly, we've still been working on humanoid robots. And this robot is called ARTEMIS, our latest one, Advanced Robotics Technology for Enhanced Mobility and Improved Stability. And this is the very first time I'm showing it to the general public. This is a sneak peek of what is about to come. Now, this robot, ARTEMIS, uses a new type of technology. It's based on that BEAR actuator. And because it's so new, you cannot buy any of these components. So we have to design and fabricate every single part of this robot. We have just finished assembly of the lower body, and I'm very excited to show you a sneak peek of robot ARTEMIS. (Suspenseful music) And ARTEMIS is coming too, I cannot wait to show it to you, probably on stage in my next talk. I've shown you a lot of our newest creation robots from our lab RoMeLa. I would like to give credit to our brilliant, hardworking students at RoMeLa. But what is the source of this creativity? What's the source of this energy? What is the secret to this crazy productivity? I think the next video will be able to answer that question. (Music) (Video) Man: Look at that. DH: You remember BALLU? We're doing the experiment of dancing. By the way, this is Saturday, 2am in the morning. (Music) (Laughter) We're having too much fun, so, yeah, let's bring out all of our robots, one by one. (Music) You remember NABi? (Music) An early prototype of ALPHRED. (Music continues) Everybody's favorite, DARwIn-OP. The rotating knee mechanism for NABi. (Music continues) The six-legged hexapod robot. (Music continues) This is RoMeLa, the Robotics and Mechanism Laboratory at UCLA. (Music continues) By the way, that's me on the left, dancing. You probably haven't seen a professor dance and party with their students while conducting serious experiments, right? Openness, freedom, trust, having fun and truly believing what you do can change the world. These are some of the secrets behind our next seven species of robot. Thank you very much.

A socialist perspective on the pursuit of happiness,Technology,Aaron Bastani,"Several crises are set to define the next century -- but journalist Aaron Bastani believes we have the technological ability to meet our biggest challenges and create unprecedented levels of prosperity for all. He shows how we could get there by ditching capitalism as the world's economic operating system and adopting ""universal basic services,"" where governments would freely provide life essentials like housing, health care, education and transport. (Followed by Q&A with head of TED Chris Anderson and public finance expert Maja Bosnic)","Allow me to introduce myself. I’m a writer, journalist and a socialist. I also used to be broke. I did, for a long time. Being a student, trying to make a name for myself in the media industry and starting a media organization. I had to move 15 times in 15 years because the rent in London just kept on going up. Now, this taught me an important lesson, firsthand. Namely, you can want to study public policy or astrophysics, you can want to make a name for yourself, you can want to do an honest day’s work. But all of that is extraordinarily difficult if your mind is thinking about those unpaid bills. Or knowing, with the fullness of your heart, that when you go to the cashpoint, it's going to respond ""Insufficient funds."" Now, while I was going through all this -- which, I have to say, happened a little bit too long for my liking -- I agreed with the ideas that I was reading from the liberal tradition, namely that individuals are uniquely placed to determine how their lives should unfold -- nobody else is. For everybody in this room, the best person to decide how your life should unfold is you. There’s no higher authority, certainly not the state. But what was equally clear was that, in the absence of access to certain resources -- education, transport, health care and housing -- that capacity for self-authorship is clearly limited for many people. We clearly live in a society where what we view as liberty, the pursuit of happiness, is limited for the majority of the global population. For many, it's illusory. It turns out that liberal ends of self-authorship, of determining how your life should unfold, require socialist means. The state must get involved. Now, we live in a world where capitalism has completely prevailed. It's won. I was asked, behind stage, ""What are you wearing?"" I said, ""Chanel Allure."" And I'm the communist. (Laughter) OK? So I'm under no illusions -- it has completely prevailed. And the ideas driving it are those of economic liberalism. Economic liberalism says what I've just said to you. The individual is uniquely placed to determine how their life unfolds, and that this should happen through the market. But there's a problem. While the market can be an extraordinary resource to get the things you need to get to be who you want to be, for many, it's the opposite. It’s a source of un-freedom. It's a constraint. It's more akin to a system of rationing than of prosperity. We know this is the case for an increasing number of people, because the numbers don't lie. In 2018, 40 million Americans used food stamps -- 13 million more than in 2007, before the global financial crisis. Clearly, something is broken. You can disagree with me about everything else, but those are the facts. In the UK, a much smaller country, in 2016, 17 million people of working age had 100 pounds or less savings. They are one minor accident away from penury. 17 million people of working age. And on the thing that capitalism asks to be judged by, global growth, it says, ""All this terrible stuff happens, inequality, poverty, whatever -- but we've still got growth."" Well, actually, the story isn't so great there either. Despite the rise of China, global growth is in secular decline. So, to be clear, the global economy is still growing, but at a smaller, slower rate, decade on decade. 20 years ago, if you said the term ""lost decade,"" you were talking about Japan. My apologies to anybody here of Japanese heritage. Today, it's an appropriate term for much of the global economy. From Britain to Italy, South Africa to Brazil, as one lost decade becomes two. And it gets worse. This economic malaise we've seen over the last 15 years is surely to be joined by the climate crisis, and then, demographic aging, a crisis of elderly care. It turns out that the opening decades of the 21st century, as bad as they were, for many, are merely the leading edge of a hurricane. Now ... despite everything I've just said to you, I'm an optimist. I believe that humans have the ingenuity to address all of these challenges and reach unprecedented prosperity and liberty for all. That can happen by employing the state and leveraging the technology revolution. I wrote a book about it. It's called ""Fully Automated Luxury Communism."" (Laughter) The c-word. (Laughter) Fully automated, because we need an economic system which reduces the necessity of human labor in the production process. Luxury, because we need to expand the sense of liberty and leisure time for all. Communism, because what I believe is heading our way this century, maybe, could see the end of production for exchange and the necessity of humans to sell their labor for a wage. But in politics, big ideas only get you so far. That's been a problem for the Left historically, I don't know if you know. And what matters in the here and now, in 2022, are concrete proposals. So how do we leverage the technology revolution? How do we employ the state to address all the challenges I've just spoken about, which I'm pretty sure everybody in this room would acknowledge? Rising inequality, the climate crisis, demographic aging. For some, the answer is a universal basic income, a UBI. Now, despite being a millennial, and still petrified when I look at my bank balance, I'm not a fan. And the reason is an affordable UBI is ineffective, and an effective UBI is unaffordable. My proposal, instead, is universal basic services, UBS. These are services which are universally available, free at the point of consumption and paid for through progressive taxation, a bit like the NHS in the UK. I propose four of these universal basic services -- health care, housing, transport and education. Why these four? Housing, because you can't focus on long-term problem-solving, or making something of yourself, if you have to move every 12 months. Believe me, I know. Health care, because the basis of everything else is physical and mental well-being. Education, because you can't be of service to your community if you don't have skills, and we need to start acknowledging that an educated society is a public good. People training as dentists, as midwives, as engineers -- hey, as accountants. We need those people. Society needs those people, with those skills, to not just thrive, but to survive, and we all benefit from them having those skills. Transport, because you can have the skills, you can have the housing, but location can remain a constraint on access to opportunity. So, you might agree with me so far, you might say, ""Aaron, I get it. Market failure exists, it's a thing. And yeah, OK, the state should intervene in some areas, fine. But why universal? Surely, we should focus scarce resources on those that need help the most."" It turns out that two academics gave a pretty good answer to that, 20 years ago. Surprise, they were Swedish. And they found that countries with universal welfare systems saw the lowest rates of hardship, the lowest rates of inequality, and universal welfare systems commanded the broadest possible consent. If you want to see the citation, it's Walter Korpi and Joachim Palme. Go on Google Scholar, find it. Now, how does that work? Why is that the case? Well, it turns out that universal welfare systems, because of the nature of how they work, have less bureaucracy. Because they don't employ means testing, there's less stigma attached, so the people accessing resources actually use them, as opposed to what we get with means testing, where you feel like you shouldn't be doing that. And importantly, they have the buy-in of that political class that is all-important in democracy, the middle class. There's a reason why the NHS in Britain is still around after 80 years, and it's so loved. It's because everybody gets to use it. It's part of the national fabric. It’s part of our shared social conversation and space. It’s something that belongs to all of us in the UK, and we're very proud of it. So if you want welfare services which address hardship, reduce inequality, are effective, efficient and broadly liked, make them universal. ""OK, I like universal services, but how do we pay for this?"" In a word, tax. Hardly reinventing the wheel, I know. In the United States, in the 1950s, the top rate of tax was 90 percent. Today, it's 37 percent. In the UK, for much of Margaret Thatcher's premiership, the top rate of tax was 60 percent. Today, it's 45 percent. Dwight Eisenhower and the Iron Lady -- hardly two radical Marxists. And then, there's things like financial transactions tax. All the outrage, in fact, that we tax work more than we tax wealth, which is astonishing. In the UK and the US, capital gains are taxed lower than incomes. How the hell does that work? Talk about a rigged system, Then, there's the issue around the technology revolution. And this is a big reason why I like universal basic services. If I'm right, then the trends in the 21st century are deflationary. Energy, information, labor are getting cheap, they're deflationary, and they'll remain deflationary for a very long time. Hard to believe, I know, in 2022, when you're filling up at the tank, but renewables trends are clear, and that will be the case for a very long time. Now, do we want those trends to underpin universal basic services, or prop up shareholders, or create the basis for new monopolistic models? Finally, on the climate crisis, another reason for universal basic services. A UBI would be an extraordinary amount of money to spend. And yet, I don't see quite what it would do in terms of transitioning our economies away from fossil fuels, which again, I'm sure everybody in this room acknowledges, we have to do pretty damn quickly. Meanwhile, with universal basic services, we can put a post-carbon agenda at the heart of education, health care, transport and housing, rapidly decarbonizing our economies. And look, to move away from fossil fuels, we need to do the one thing that market fundamentalists hate, and that's called planning. So, cast your minds to 2100, and a world after capitalism as we know it. You go to your job four hours a day in an elderly care center, one of the few labor-intensive industries that's still around. Afterwards, you go for lunch, you see your friends and you talk about taking that holiday in some rewilded forest somewhere, go see some bison and some bears. And you talk about wanting to study for that third college degree, this time in medicine, because you're working with older people and you're fascinated by the sphere, the area, the growth industry of radical life extension. And hey, your first two degrees didn't cost a thing, and that second one, East Asian Literature, gave you a whole new perspective on life. You really loved Japanese poetry after that. Pretty good, right? You get a notification as you leave that lunch. Your local health care clinic's saying you need to go for a quick checkup. You go down there, you take a bus -- free, electric, self-driving. The local bus co-op uses a powerful predictive algorithm to determine how much supply is needed at what time for optimal efficiency and effectiveness. Compare that to rush hour in LA or London. Big difference -- I know which I prefer. You end up at the local health clinic. They say, ""Look, it's time for liquid biopsy. You missed your checkup last week."" You go in -- stage zero cancer. No problem, some pills will fix that. At every stage of this narrative, the health care, the transport, the college degrees, the elderly care, we've seen universal basic services in action. Universally available, free at the point of consumption and paid for through progressive taxation. Now, this might sound utopian. Personally, I think it's technically easier to do than colonizing Mars, but our society somehow thinks differently. But it's not utopian. In fact, in many ways, this world resembles our own. There are still markets for many, many things. The state isn't involved in making chocolate bars or socks or silk ties. But it is the central player in these four things we all need for liberty: housing, education, health care and transport. And to say it's no utopia means bad things still happen, yes. There are fallings out, there's personal enmity, there are love affairs, you fall in and out of love. Often, falling in love is worse, it's more dangerous. These things still happen, but they're better than homelessness, than being unable to pay for your insulin, or failing to address the climate crisis as a species. It’s time we lived up to those glorious words: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And recognize that, for the majority of the global population, the pursuit of happiness is impossible. It's downright illusory, unless they have access to universal basic services. This is the way by which we guarantee liberty for all and address the great challenges of the 21st century -- the climate crisis, inequality, demographic aging -- whilst leveraging these remarkable technologies that the ingenuity of our species has created. I don't think there's another way of addressing those challenges. I think anybody who thinks otherwise is delusional, frankly. But all that means we're going to have to do something which, for the political establishment and status-quo thinking, has been anathema for decades. And that means returning the state -- yes, the state -- to the center stage of our economic and social lives. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you, Aaron. I think we have a secret questioner somewhere, in the form of Maja Bosnic, who is a public finance expert. She spoke recently at TEDWomen. Maja, what's your question? Maja Bosnic: Yes, thank you very much. So my question is basically related to resistances. I work with public services, and I work towards making them more gender-responsive, so I know a thing or two about resistances. So I wanted to ask you, what do you see as the biggest resistances? And in which one, or maybe some of these four that you are mentioning? Thank you. Aaron Bastani: Great question, thank you. For me, it’s got to be housing. Because, particularly in the Anglo-American economies, we have a growth model built upon speculative investment in housing assets. The reality is, for the likes of the UK and the US -- the Canadian property market is probably quite similar -- we need to have something akin to what Japan has seen over the last 25 years, which is, effectively, flat house price increases. Sorry, I should phrase that better -- zero percent growth in house prices. So wages can catch up. I saw an amazing statistic, actually, the other day in the UK, which showed that a majority of homeowners in the UK are happy to have zero growth on house prices. And that makes sense. Why would you want your house to gain in value? All it means is you buy another house, which has relatively gone up as well. And I think people acknowledge that this isn’t working for people who rent, who don't own the assets. And I would rather keep that price flat, and, you know, have more people included in our economy. But that's, I think, the big structural challenge -- we would have to take on speculative investment in housing. CA: Thank you, Maja. Aaron, I'm really taken by this argument for UBS, partly because, just structurally, some of those things naturally get organized better if there's only one of them, not a bunch in competition. You compare US health care capitalism with something like the NHS or the state things, which, for all their faults, seem to deliver equally good or better health care for, like, half the money. Transport, you can make the same argument. But have you cost it out? To roll out all these four, that's a massive investment. Have you costed it? AB: I haven't costed it. University College London has costed universal basic services, and they had six -- they included food, which is pretty ambitious. In the US private health care system, 16 percent of GDP's spent on health care. In the UK, it's 10 percent. And we have longer life expectancy, fewer women dying in childbirth, lower infant mortality. So clearly, something is going right. And you might say, ""The NHS is underfunded."" Bump up by one or two percent. And of course, we have universal coverage. So there's a strong argument there for public health care, from an efficiency perspective -- (Applause) AB: Thank you. (Applause) And I would respond with this, in regards to elderly care. If you look at the crisis of demographic aging, and elderly care that’s coming down the line because of lower birth replacement rates of an aging population. And I want one of these geniuses to come up with us living to 200. But if that happens, we then create a crisis of elderly care, and the reality is, it's not that we can't afford to do UBS, a UBS of elderly care, if that happens -- we can't afford not to do it. Because I then return to the NHS point about efficiency, particularly in elderly care. If you don't have that as a UBS, you're in big trouble, in my view. CA: Aaron, thanks for an incredibly compelling contribution to the debate. AB: Thank you, cheers. (Applause)",PT19M08S,2023-01-20T15:54:11Z
Why nurses are key to medical innovation,Technology,Ben Gran,"Nurses represent the front line of health care -- from first breaths to last moments, and everything in between. But there's a vital place nurses are missing in action, says Ben Gran. He makes a compelling case for integrating their invaluable insights and experience into health tech innovation to help make care (and the process of providing it) better for generations to come.","I love nursing. And I also love innovation. However, often when I speak about innovation within the field of nursing, I’m met with: ""Ugh."" And it's understandable. Innovation in technology within the health care sector is growing really fast. And sometimes it can be a little bit difficult to keep up with the new technologies. And now, as a new professional within the field, I'm slowly starting to relate a little bit more to this response. Us nurses are already really busy. We're not offered the opportunity to innovate, and quite frankly, we're not paid enough. However, if we could change this attitude of innovation earlier on, during nursing education, I believe we could have our future nurses innovate in a way to improve the working quality for health care professionals, which in turn will improve patient care. This is the key to making our future nurses the stakeholders within the future development of the health care system. So what is innovation? It's a bit of an ambiguous word that can mean a lot of different things to many different people. But simply put, innovation is looking at a problem, understanding it and trying to make it better. And if you make it better, that's innovation. Innovation can be applied to something which already exists, or it can be used to develop something completely new. But before we go deeper into this topic, let me tell you all a story which inspired me to have this speech here today. When I started my final internship for my nursing studies at the end of 2020, I had an interview with the ward manager on the first day. One of the questions which she asked me was, ""So, Ben, where do you see yourself going in the next five to 10 years?"" Honestly, I had to think about it for a little while. And then I told her, ""Well, to be honest, I don't think I can be a nurse forever. It's really hard work. Like, really, really hard. Both physically and emotionally. But I am passionate about health care and would love to pursue a future career in health care innovation and technology."" And yes, I know some you might think it’s a little bit strange for a near-graduate to be planning on leaving his career on the first day of his internship. And, you know what she said? Well, she said, ""Oh, I see. I'm not too sure about this whole innovation thing. I'm not really a big fan."" Whoa, whoa, whoa, OK. I was taken aback. See, that's what I wanted to do. The egotistical part of me wanted to say, “What do you mean, you don’t like innovation? You don't want to improve the working quality for health care professionals, which, in turn, will improve patient care?” Well, I didn't say that, obviously. Instead, I asked her one simple question. And that was: ""Why?"" And what she told me gave me the biggest light-bulb moment. She said, “Well, too often a businessperson or an engineer comes to me with a new technology or innovative idea. And more often than not, it's not very user-friendly, or it just adds more to our workload."" OK. So I'm standing there and I'm thinking, Ding! This is the moment that I realized that there's a huge disconnect between the developer and the end user within the health care sector. In fact, this isn't the first time I've gotten this kind of response. Throughout my studies and now my career, I've often recognized that there's a bit of a frustration factor whenever new technologies or processes are introduced. So on our days full of making reports, taking patients' vitals, communicating with doctors, physiotherapists, family members, taking patients' vitals again and charting and God, am I forgetting something? Well, that's honestly on a good day. But most of the time we're covering for our colleagues who are away on sick leave due to burnout, taking on extra administrative roles because hospitals are trying to save money. And answering call bells. The call bells. Especially to independent patients who all of a sudden can't do anything for themselves anymore. So if there's anybody out there who knows a nurse, which most of you probably do, go ahead and ask them to share a story with you about call bells and these kinds of patients. They’re often quite amusing, but at the time, oh, so frustrating. So, yeah, adding a new technology or process on top of all of this, especially when going through beta stage flaws, only adds on to the headache. And you see, nursing is changing. It's not the same that it was 20 to 30 years ago. Neither is the health care system, and it seems like education has not quite caught up. A lot of new technologies are being introduced and most of nurses' time still being spent completing mundane and repetitive tasks. In addition to this, we're seeing an aging population, we're seeing an increase in the cost of care, patients' needs are more demanding and a shortage in health care staff. However, we could have these repetitive and mundane tasks of charting aided by AI and technologies as small as a ring taking patient's vitals. This would hopefully leave more time for nurses to communicate and provide care for their patients, but also give them an opportunity to solve problems within their organizations. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that by 2030 there's going to be a global health care shortage with nine million those being nursing-specific. This is caused by experienced nurses coming towards their retirement, a poor retention rate of new professionals and less people entering the field altogether. It's not looking very good. So we're at a point now where we can no longer wait and see if these advancements will happen in the health care sector. We’re at a point now where these advancements, technologies have to happen. But who are the ones who should be driving these advancements and technologies? Well, the answer is, frontline health care workers, nurses. We're the ones who have been using all of the technologies which have been introduced thus far. We work with them every day, see where their flaws are, and some of us might have pretty good ideas on how to make them better. But most importantly, us nurses are the ones who truly understand what aspects of our jobs can be replaced with future technologies. If we can combine the frontline experience of nurses with the innovative approaches of businesspeople and engineers, just imagine the improvements we could see. We could actually start solving the problems nurses face every day by including them, the end user, within the development phase. So that comes now to my main question. How do we solve this multi-dimensional issue? It is quite a big one. Well, a good start would be by looking into our education system. From my experience, going through my bachelor degree in nursing, they take a bunch of nursing students where a nurse in the front of the class teaches them about nursing. And it makes sense. But what this does is it creates a nursing bubble within the university, and sometimes it can be a little bit difficult to penetrate through that barrier. What it does is it narrows your path to where what you learn is only useful for that profession without exploration and problem solving within the industry. As a nursing student going through a bachelor's degree, you're merely handed the tools and taught how to use them. There's very little emphasis on being able to look at that tool and thinking, ""Aha, this would work much better if it was made like this."" And here's the thing. Universities are networking havens. We're literally working in establishments where we have people working on business and marketing, IT, engineering, design, culture, health care. And that is only the tip of the iceberg. As a student, I was lucky enough to be a part of a group who were really keen on extracurricular innovation projects. We had a diverse group of students, myself a nurse, two industrial designers, a cultural manager and a health tech engineer. This experience taught me so much about the importance of networking and how to work within a multi-professional team. And I couldn’t help but think that every single student should have an opportunity like this and solve real-life problems. But most importantly, it showed me that we needed each other to make this project become alive. During the same time, we also established a nonprofit which looked at enriching the innovative and entrepreneurial culture amongst the university students. I was lucky to have an experience like this, and I should acknowledge that there are the beginnings of innovation education within nursing studies, but it's at its infancy stage and not held as a priority within the classroom. So if there's any nursing educators out there, in fact, all educators who aren't already doing this, is to -- if there's one thing I would like to ask is that you let your students out of that bubble. Make them professionally mix and match, interact, network and work on projects with students going through different courses within your university. From my experience in the projects that I did with my colleagues, I can see a huge benefit in this kind of cross-course collaboration. What might come out of it can be truly special, and the connections you get from them can last a lifetime. Now, when you really think about it, how can we develop easily adoptable technologies for nurses if we never get a chance to learn how to really sit down and work within a multi-professional team? So in our future careers as health care professionals, when we come across a potential problem, we can draw from those past experiences and networks we gained as students to at least get started with innovation process. Now there are many barriers nurses and health tech developers face within the health care sector. Educating our nurses about innovation and what's to come in the future of the health care system, we can slowly start to make them the stakeholders within the strategy. However, education is not an end-all solution. The solution lies in a more integrative approach where education, technology, governance, leadership, laws, finances are all taken into consideration. But these are all entire TEDx Talks in themselves and outside of my personal experience. So if there's anybody out there listening who's an expert within the field, I would like to invite somebody to come up here and speak about how we can start solving these issues. We need to get this ball rolling because time is seriously starting to run out. And now, for myself as a new professional within the field, if there's a message that I would like to share, that is that if you’re a start-up, innovator, businessperson, engineer or anybody working on a health care-related technology or service, is to get in contact with the nurse. Ask us how can this product or service be made better to suit our needs better. Trust me, we want to help. That's kind of why we're nurses to begin with. And while I'm on the topic, I would also like to encourage nurses and students to get more involved. Find like-minded people in societies. These might be part of the hospital you're working for or within your local university. And if you have a business or innovation idea, share it. Speak to people and find other services within your community. There are health care-related hackathons, incubators and other kinds of services to help you construct these ideas better. Now, studies have shown that innovation empowers nurses when it looks at ways of improving patient care, technologies and processes. However, this is only possible with financial support, health care leaders promoting an environment where intellectual creativity is promoted and employees get the recognition and prestige that they deserve. However. Time and time again, when I've spoken to nurses as a student and now as a professional, it seems like there's something preventing nurses from achieving this. There's something fundamentally preventing nurses from innovating more. Well, nurses are overworked, burning out, underpaid, often unappreciated with their own organizations, especially within the public sector. But most importantly, we aren't offered the opportunity to truly demonstrate our potential. Now, as AI and technologies assume many tasks of nurses in the near future, we need to educate and facilitate our future nurses to be the stakeholders within the future development of the health care system. Our future nurses will be the health care information integrators, health care consultants, health coaches and providers of human care, supported by these technologies and AI, not replaced by them. After all ... One of the first human interactions you have in life is with a nurse in the maternity ward. And one of your last will be with a nurse by your bedside. The way we support our nurses in society is a choice. So please help us nurses so we can help you innovate. Let's build a better future together. Thank you. (Applause)",PT16M12S,2023-01-11T16:05:04Z
What the discovery of exoplanets reveals about the universe,Technology,Jessie Christiansen,"What are the planets outside our solar system like? Astrophysicist and TED Fellow Jessie Christiansen has helped find thousands of them (and counting), and the variety is more wonderful and wild than you might imagine. She shares details on the trends emerging from the data -- including the intriguing possibility of ""super-Earths"" -- and what the discovery of exoplanets means for existential questions like: Where do we come from, and how did we get here?","I am a planet hunter and keeper of the keys at NASA's Exoplanet Archive. In March 2022, we reached a major milestone in space exploration: 5,000 known exoplanets. For thousands of years, we've wondered about planets outside of our solar system, now called exoplanets. But our technology only recently caught up with our imaginations. And yes, 5,000 planets is incredible. What's even more incredible is how space research will change as a result. When I started grad school, there were about 100 known exoplanets, all radically different from the Earth and from each other. I was determined to find more. I spent four years looking at nearly 87,000 stars, one by one. Now you might have this romantic idea that I was gazing intently through a telescope, pondering some gorgeous view of the universe. I was not. I was looking at data like this, measuring the brightness of each star over time. If the brightness dipped, just briefly, just a little bit, it could be because a planet had orbited in front of that star, blocking some of the light from reaching my telescope. So I spent four years looking for decimal-level changes in these data. And after four years, I'd found ... nothing. Zero exoplanets. Thankfully, they still gave me the PhD, I think, for effort. (Laughter) Then I moved to Harvard, where I worked on my first NASA mission, called EPOXI. I still didn't find any exoplanets. Then in March 2010, I joined the Kepler Mission, NASA's grand experiment with putting one of our planet-hunting instruments into space. Monday was my first day on the base in Silicon Valley. It was mostly spent in HR. Tuesday, I sat down and looked at the data for the first time, and I found my first exoplanet. (Cheers) (Applause) A few minutes later, I found another one. There's a saying that we're the generation that was born too late to explore Earth and too soon to explore space. That's not true anymore. That day and every day since, I've gotten to explore space. Kepler made it possible for us to measure stellar brightness much more precisely than we had before. And eventually I helped find thousands of exoplanets. And we've really only searched our local corner of the galaxy to find those planets. That means there's likely tens of billions of planets just in our Milky Way. Now with so much data, we can start sorting and grouping and categorizing these planets to find trends. Think of it this way: if you wanted to learn about dogs and you had five dogs in your study, well, you'd learn a lot about those five dogs. That they're all good dogs. But maybe not about dogs in general. If you had 5,000 dogs in your study, then you’d start to see that there were German Shepherds and Dobermanns and beagles, and that these different breeds have different features. With demographic-level data on exoplanets, we can start asking some of these big questions for the first time, like: Of those thousands and billions of planets in our galaxy, how many are like the Earth, or like Jupiter? How many planets does a typical star have? Can a planet orbit more than one star? Yes. Can a planet exist without any star at all? Also yes. One surprising result from the study of planet populations is that the most common kind of planet in our galaxy might be one we don’t have in our solar system: a super-Earth up to twice as big and ten times as heavy as our Earth. We've found evaporating planets, disintegrating planets, planets clustered together in a clockwork dance, ultra-puffy planets, ultra-dense planets. It's truly a wild and wonderful menagerie that I get to corral at the NASA Exoplanet Archive. But it gets even more interesting than that. With so much data, we might finally be able to figure out how planets are made. We see baby stars being born in stellar nurseries surrounded by dust and gas. And we see all the stars surrounded by completed planetary systems. But we still don't really know what happens in between. With more data, we might find planets at some middle stage or many middle stages. And from there, be able to map out a timeline of planetary development. What triggers these diffused clouds of dust and gas to collapse and transform? And how does the chaos and turmoil of dust become pebbles, and pebbles become boulders, and boulders become planetesimals? And from there, after an intense series of bombardments eventually settle into an ordered series of planets. How often is one of those planets solid and warm, with a water ocean lapping a sandy shore? Where do we come from, and how did we get here? The more we learn about exoplanets, the easier it is to target the ones we want. So far, we haven't found any planets that are like the Earth. But I hope we will. NASA just spent the last few years studying the idea of a very large telescope in space with next-generation technology that would allow us to take an image, an actual photograph, of a planet like the Earth. With that photo, we could search for biomarkers, signatures of life. I'll probably spend the rest of my career working on that mission. I hope I get to take that photo. Thank you.

The internet's accessibility problem -- and how to fix it,Technology,Clive Loseby,"The internet provides access to knowledge for billions across the world, but how accessible is it really? Website accessibility advocate Clive Loseby sheds light on why many parts of the web are closed off to those with disabilities -- and lays out some steps to make being online better for everyone.","Hi, everyone. I'm Clive Loseby and I am passionate about changing the world, one website at a time. As Dale said I was in a bad car crash a long time ago. It left us all with life-changing injuries. And that's why accessibility and website accessibility has become my passion. The accident also left me with a very bad memory, so please forgive me if I keep looking at my notes. OK. Does everybody know what a cookie banner is? Those annoying banners that pop up on a website asking for consent to put cookies into your browser? It may say something like, ""This website uses cookies to give you the best online experience. Follow this link to confirm that you consent to this.” Does everyone know what I'm talking about? (Audience: Yes!) Good. Right, now I want you to imagine a different kind of browser. This one says the following: ""This website is designed for white people only. Follow this link to confirm that you are white."" Or, ""This website is for men only. Follow this link to confirm that you are a man."" Or, ""This website is for straight people only. Follow this link to confirm that you are straight."" Or even, ""This website is for people who have hair. Follow this link to confirm you have hair."" OK. These don't happen in the real world, but what I do need to tell you about is another banner that does exist on over 97% of the world's websites. ""This website is for people who are not disabled. Follow this link to confirm that you are not disabled."" This may not be as apparent as the cookie banner. Believe me, this banner exists. Ninety-seven point four percent  of 1 million website home pages tested last year had detectable accessibility failures. So how many disabled people are there in the world? In 2010, the World Health Organization estimated that 1 billion  people on the planet live with some form of disability, with over 110 million having highly significant difficulties in functioning. We are talking about a lot of people. They also would like to use the web as much as you or I do. They also want to become your customers and spend money with you, if you make it possible for them to do so. The title of this talk is a direct quote from somebody I met last year. She works in health, safety, employee well-being and has done for 20 years, so she has a real understanding of inclusivity. Lovely, caring person, but she just could not understand how blind people could use the internet because they couldn't see the screen. I explained to her what a screen reader was and she got it. A screen reader, by the way, is a piece of software that reads out the content of a website using a computerized voice. If you're blind, you can't use a mouse because you can't see where to put it. So you will use your keyboard instead in conjunction with the screen reader. It's not that easy to do but cookie banners make life so much worse. And in some cases, they actually prevent blind people from accessing the website beyond it. We are in the year 2022. The first set of guidelines for websites to help ensure that they met the needs of disabled people were released quite recently, actually, in 1999. A mere 23 years ago. Yep. I'm not joking. All the information has been available to everyone since then. It is also a legal requirement in most countries, but above everything else, it helps every business and every organization become more inclusive. And yet, 97% of websites contained detectable accessibility failures last year. Think of a website as a building, it becomes even more obvious. After all, websites are physical buildings. They're your window on the world, aren't they? Legislation for access to physical buildings has always made allowances for very old buildings where it's simply not possible to make them fully accessible for people with disabilities. We all understand that. So actually, I think it's perfectly fair that you shouldn't expect a website over 23 years old to cater for disabled people either. I'm actually not sure the last time I went on a website that was over 23 years old. But what about five years old or about three years old? What about last year? This year? Typically, websites get replaced every three to five years as a new one is built to cater for the latest trends. Is it really OK that websites that are recently built are still inaccessible for disabled people? If not now, when? OK, so what does accessible web design actually mean? Please take a look at these doors. They both go into the same building. Both sets of doors have level access. The door on the left slides open automatically as you approach it. The doors on the right have to be pulled open. I would like to ask you all a question, and if you are able, I would like you to either raise your left hand or your right hand in answer. Imagine you're in a wheelchair and you want to enter this building. Which of the doors do you think you would be most likely to use? The automatic doors on the left or the heavy doors on the right? Could you please raise your left or your right hand accordingly? Well, I think it's fair to say the consensus is on the left. Interesting. OK. Now instead of being in a wheelchair, you're using a walking frame, so you can walk, but you need to have both of your hands on the frame. Which set of doors do you think you would be likely to use now? Could you raise your hands if you're able to? I'm really surprised. Everyone's going left. OK. Right. Now you're pushing a child in a pushchair so you can walk quite normally, but you've got a pushchair and both of your hands on it. Which set of doors now? Left or right? I'm staggered. OK. Final example. Let's assume that you've actually gone in through the doors on the right. You're coming out, you want to come out the building, but you've actually got boxes of files under both arms. Which of the doors would you go then? Yeah. Hmm. I'm really staggered. In pretty much every example pretty much everybody raised your left hand. Why was this? After all, you’re free to choose which door to use at each time. Why would so many people go for an automatic door? Maybe because it's easier. Nobody's forcing you to use it. It's there as an alternative to the other doors. Accessible web design is exactly the same, offering people with different needs alternative ways of using a website to get the same information. Most countries around the world have anti-discrimination laws, and websites fall under these laws. However, for me, it's not about complying with the law. It is about becoming more inclusive, more welcoming to everyone, regardless of their ability or their disability. Disabled people have money to spend on your goods and services and if they can't spend it with you, they're going to spend it with somebody else. So what should you do with regard to your own website? Well, you need to have two things. You need to have an audit of your website, and then you need to put an accessibility statement on your website. I'll explain what I mean in this photograph. This hotel, it's a beautiful building. There’s downstairs seating. There’s upstairs seating. There's beautiful staircases everywhere, but unfortunately, there isn't a lift. The restaurant itself is run by an outside catering company. It's not their fault there's no lift. It's not their building, they're just renting the space. However, if you're in a wheelchair, you can't use the upstairs seating. But if there was a sign near the entrance saying something like, ""Patrons in wheelchairs, please note that although we've got upstairs seating, we do not have a lift. However, we do have some reserved seating for you with extra turning space and raised tables."" Think about raised tables. If you're in a wheelchair and you try to go into a restaurant anywhere, you can't quite get under the table. Easily fixed, just put them on some small wooden blocks. Anyway, if you just put up that sign, somebody in a wheelchair who reads that sign, are they going to feel more or less included? The cost of doing this is almost nothing, but the effect is huge. It's not the catering companies fault there's no lift. They've just gone out of their way to offer an alternative despite the limitations of the hotel. In other words, the catering company themselves have become more welcoming, inclusive and accessible. So the first part of this story where I explained the restaurant has upstairs seating, but no lift. That could be seen as an audit. ""We realize there's no lift to the upstairs seating so disabled people in wheelchairs cannot use it."" But the sign at the entrance telling everyone that there is accessible seating downstairs as an alternative is like their accessibility statement. ""We've discovered that wheelchair users cannot use the upstairs seating. This is what we've done instead."" So how does all this apply to a website? Well, as far as the audit goes, you can either pay somebody or you can do it yourself. And the same goes for an accessibility statement. Sadly, I don’t have time to go into the details but I do want to say one thing. Make your accessibility statement real. What do I mean by this? Simple. I see website after website with an accessibility statement that begins with a slightly pompous tone, and it says something like, ""We fully care about people with disabilities. We want to ensure that everyone is able to fully utilize our website. It meets the following standards, blah, blah, blah."" I don't actually really care what you say. If somebody can't use your website, they can't use your website. I've got an idea. Why not instead use this as a wonderful opportunity to reach out to disabled people? The first line of your accessibility statement could be something like, “We’re aware that there’s some problems with our website that might make the experience more difficult for visitors with disabilities. But if there’s anything that we can do to help you, give us a call.” There's the phone number right there. “Follow this link to send an email.” There’s the link right there. “Or fill in the contact form.” Right there you're reaching out to them. Just by doing that, you're being inclusive. You're going the extra mile and it speaks volumes about your ethos as a company. By the way, if you do have accessibility issues with your website, you should give a time frame in which you're going to get them fixed or at least explain that it’s not possible on grounds of cost. It isn't about being perfect. It's about being honest. OK, I'd like to finish by telling you all about a very simple test that you can do on any website to find out if it has a basic level of accessibility. Anyone can do it. And I call it the Tab Test. If you're on a website, there will usually be a row of page navigation buttons along the top. As you move your mouse over them, they will light up in turn and any subpages will appear as a kind of drop-down. And they may also light up as you move the mouse over. In other words, just by moving your mouse, you can go to pretty much any page on the website with a single click. Do we all understand that? Brilliant. If you're blind, as I've said, you can't use a mouse. Instead, you use a screen reader and a keyboard. If a website has a basic level of accessibility, you should be able to select every page and subpage by repeatedly pressing the Tab key. Not only that, each one should light up in turn, just as if you were using a mouse. Not everyone who is visually impaired is completely blind. In fact, most of them have some form of limited vision instead. So having page navigation light up as you move, as you Tab through them, helps them know where they are. So next time anybody here is on a website, just start pressing the Tab key. If you do not see all the pages and all the subpages light up in turn, it's failed the test. Please drop them an email informing them that because their website does not meet that basic level of accessibility, it's failed this test and they really need to do something about it. They want to know more, they can do a quick internet search and actually it's fairly easy to fix. If you guys joined with me in doing this one simple thing, we all will truly be changing the world, one website at a time. Thank you very much. (Applause)",PT13M32S,2022-12-21T16:23:47Z
Are insect brains the secret to great AI?,Technology,Frances S. Chance,"Are insects the key to brain-inspired computing? Neuroscientist Frances S. Chance thinks so. In this buzzy talk, she shares examples of the incredible capabilities of insects -- like the dragonfly's deadly accurate hunting skills and the African dung beetle's superstrength -- and shows how untangling the mysterious web of neurons in their tiny brains could lead to breakthroughs in computers, AI and more.","Creating intelligence on a computer. This has been the Holy Grail for artificial intelligence for quite some time. But how do we get there? So we view ourselves as highly intelligent beings. So it's logical to study our own brains, the substrate of our cognition, for creating artificial intelligence. Imagine if we could replicate how our own brains work on a computer. But now consider the journey that would be required. The human brain contains 86 billion neurons. Each is constantly communicating with thousands of others, and each has individual characteristics of its own. Capturing the human brain on a computer may simply be too big and too complex a problem to tackle with the technology and the knowledge that we have today. I believe that we can capture a brain on a computer, but we have to start smaller. Much smaller. These insects have three of the most fascinating brains in the world to me. While they do not possess human-level intelligence, each is remarkable at a particular task. Think of them as highly trained specialists. African dung beetles are really good at rolling large balls in straight lines. (Laughter) Now, if you've ever made a snowman, you know that rolling a large ball is not easy. Now picture trying to make that snowman when the ball of snow is as big as you are and you're standing on your head. (Laughter) Sahara desert ants are navigation specialists. They might have to wander a considerable distance to forage for food. But once they do find sustenance, they know how to calculate the straightest path home. And the dragonfly is a hunting specialist. In the wild, dragonflies capture approximately 95 percent of the prey they choose to go after. These insects are so good at their specialties that neuroscientists such as myself study them as model systems to understand how animal nervous systems solve particular problems. And in my own research, I study brains to bring these solutions, the best that biology has to offer, to computers. So consider the dragonfly brain. It has only on the order of one million neurons. Now, it's still not easy to unravel a circuit of even one million neurons. But given the choice between trying to tease apart the one-million-neuron brain versus the 86-billion-neuron brain, which would you choose to try first? (Laughter) When studying these smaller insect brains, the immediate goal is not human intelligence. We study these brains for what the insects do well. And in the case of the dragonfly, that's interception. So when dragonflies are hunting, they do more than just fly straight at the prey. They fly in such a way that they will intercept it. They aim for where the prey is going to be. Much like a soccer player, running to intercept a pass. To do this correctly, dragonflies need to perform what is known as a coordinate transformation, going from the eye’s frame of reference, or what the dragonfly sees, to the body's frame of reference, or how the dragonfly needs to turn its body to intercept. Coordinate transformations are a basic calculation that animals need to perform to interact with the world. We do them instinctively every time we reach for something. When I reach for an object straight in front of me, my arm takes a very different trajectory than if I turn my head, look at that same object when it is off to one side and reach for it there. In both cases, my eyes see the same image of that object, but my brain is sending my arm on a very different trajectory based on the position of my neck. And dragonflies are fast. This means they calculate fast. The latency, or the time it takes for a dragonfly to respond once it sees the prey turn, is about 50 milliseconds. This latency is remarkable. For one thing, it's only half the time of a human eye blink. But for another thing, it suggests that dragonflies capture how to intercept in only relatively or surprisingly few computational steps. So in the brain, a computational step is a single neuron or a layer of neurons working in parallel. It takes a single neuron about 10 milliseconds to add up all its inputs and respond. The 50-millisecond response time means that once the dragonfly sees its prey turn, there's only time for maybe four of these computational steps or four layers of neurons, working in sequence, one after the other, to calculate how the dragonfly needs to turn. In other words, if I want to study how the dragonfly does coordinate transformations, the neural circuit that I need to understand, the neural circuit that I need to study, can have at most four layers of neurons. Each layer may have many neurons, but this is a small neural circuit. Small enough that we can identify it and study it with the tools that are available today. And this is what I'm trying to do. I have built a model of what I believe is the neural circuit that calculates how the dragonfly should turn. And here is the cool result. In the model, dragonflies do coordinate transformations in only one computational step, one layer of neurons. This is something we can test and understand. In a computer simulation, I can predict the activities of individual neurons while the dragonfly is hunting. For example, here I am predicting the action potentials, or the spikes, that are fired by one of these neurons when the dragonfly sees the prey move. To test the model, my collaborators and I are now comparing these predicted neural responses with responses of neurons recorded in living dragonfly brains. These are ongoing experiments in which we put living dragonflies in virtual reality. (Laughter) Now, it's not practical to put VR goggles on a dragonfly. So instead, we show movies of moving targets to the dragonfly, while an electrode records activity patterns of individual neurons in the brain. Yeah, he likes the movies. If the responses that we record in the brain match those predicted by the model, we will have identified which neurons are responsible for coordinate transformations. The next step will be to understand the specifics of how these neurons work together to do the calculation. But this is how we begin to understand how brains do basic or primitive calculations. Calculations that I regard as building blocks for more complex functions, not only for interception but also for cognition. The way that these neurons compute may be different from anything that exists on a computer today. And the goal of this work is to do more than just write code that replicates the activity patterns of neurons. We aim to build a computer chip that not only does the same things as biological brains but does them in the same way as biological brains. This could lead to drones driven by computers the same size of the dragonfly's brain that captures some targets and avoid others. Personally, I'm hoping for a small army of these to defend my backyard from mosquitoes in the summer. (Laughter) The GPS on your phone could be replaced by a new navigation device based on dung beetles or ants that could guide you to the straight or the easy path home. And what would the power requirements of these devices be like? As small as it is -- Or, sorry -- as large as it is, the human brain is estimated to have the same power requirements as a 20-watt light bulb. Imagine if all brain-inspired computers had the same extremely low-power requirements. Your smartphone or your smartwatch probably needs charging every day. Your new brain-inspired device might only need charging every few months, or maybe even every few years. The famous physicist, Richard Feynman, once said, ""What I cannot create, I do not understand."" What I see in insect nervous systems is an opportunity to understand brains through the creation of computers that work as brains do. And creation of these computers will not just be for knowledge. There's potential for real impact on your devices, your vehicles, maybe even artificial intelligences. So next time you see an insect, consider that these tiny brains can lead to remarkable computers. And think of the potential that they offer us for the future. Thank you.

Can the metaverse bring us closer to wildlife?,Technology,Gautam Shah,"Technologist and TED Fellow Gautam Shah invites us to imagine how the metaverse could redefine the relationships between humans and other species. By giving individual wild animals a personal identity (such as Fio, a young orangutan in Borneo, or Mweituria, an elephant living in Kenya) and sharing data on their migration, milestones and habitats, Shah thinks we could empathize with wildlife in a whole new way. Learn more about how emerging technology could bring us closer to the natural world -- and what the connections we build there could mean for the future of the planet.","I'm a total wildlife nerd. But I’m also a career technologist, and it took me 20 years to figure out how to combine the two towards wildlife conservation. But I think I finally got it. Technology has come so far in that time in generating data about our planet and its other non-human inhabitants. For example, there's a satellite in space that's dedicated to tracking the movements of hundreds of species. We can pluck DNA samples from rivers, soil and dung to identify individual animals. And whales and seals are swimming around right now with sensors on, collecting ocean data for us. Now, this data is incredibly valuable to the science of protecting the planet. But I think it could be even more valuable. What if we use that data to give wild animals a unique digital identity that's recognizable by humans? Now why would we do this? Well, most of us have a digital identity that we use to communicate and socialize with each other. But Albert in St. Louis, for example, has no way to create a connection with an orangutan in Borneo. How can we expect him to empathize with its protection? If we want to preserve all life on Earth, we need to create relationships with all life on Earth. And relationships are built upon recognizing someone's unique identity. So maybe giving one to that orangutan could create a bond with Albert that helps them both in the real world. Now, this is not as far-fetched as it seems. The technology and the data exist to do it. But it's not enough to just create the identities. They need a place to come alive and be found by humans. Somewhere that creates an immersive and active way to stay engaged. Well, if current predictions come true, most of our socializing, work and play will shift to games, virtual spaces and yes, the metaverse. And that's where stories will be told and relationships built. So for every human avatar that is interacting or consuming in these spaces, let’s have the same for Mweituria the elephant, Ataia the Jaguar, Fio the orangutan and hundreds of thousands more. And the events of their lives, as supported by the data, can be recreated digitally. That might be the health of Fio, the migration of Mweituria, a newborn cub to Ataia. And these events, and others, create the moments for people to feel the space to feel emotionally bonded. Not because they all of a sudden want to, but because they now have access that they never did before. Some will use that space to connect directly with orangutan researchers in Borneo. Others will identify new patterns in elephant movements. Some will learn about deforestation by actually witnessing it. And we’ll monetize this soon-to-be-trillion-dollar sector to help finance further science and habitat protection. Which means that virtual worlds can directly benefit the real world as opposed to being detached from it. And we've been experimenting with this using the real data of animals like Fio and others. And we found that while our vision is still many years away from being realized, the platforms to make it happen already exist. Microsoft's Flight Simulator, it includes two trillion of the world's trees. It could include all the world's wildlife. Adidas recently included five GPS-tracked animals as athletes in its fitness app for its users to compete against. It could include thousands more. And Fortnite recently held a virtual concert ... with Travis Scott. They transported over 27 million of their users to a fictional world to witness that concert. Let's hold the next one in the Amazon rainforest. Imagine if Ataia the Jaguar walks by during the show. Now, I'll admit I have fears that some of what I'm advocating could create a greater divide between people and the natural world. If I could, I'd just pick everybody up, I’d plop them in Borneo, and I’d have them spend an hour with Fio instead. But Fio's natural world is literally dying in front of our eyes. We need a seismic shift in how we create relationships with other species. Otherwise, yeah, the next 100 years of wildlife conservation will continue to be an uphill, losing battle. It's only a matter of time before some version of the metaverse changes the way we spend our time and engage with each other. And however you may feel about that, we have to make sure that Mweituria, Ataia, Fio and millions more animals are included, play a role and benefit. And not get left behind. Thank you.
