"In this research lab, I discovered a story that is swiftly changing our world. A story that has the power to change the way we produce material, the way we eat and the way we heal. It is the story of deep tech.

Deep tech is a new chapter in the innovation story, bringing together science, engineering and design thinking. Imagine if another global pandemic happens and the drug to combat it was developed and approved not in decades or years, but in months or even in weeks. Deep tech offers this potential. Imagine technologies like robotics, synthetic biology, nanomaterial, blockchain, quantum computing and many others -- when combined with each other and blended with engineering and design science, are making what's seemingly impossible possible.

So what is deep tech? I've spent the last 18 months visiting 100 research labs and start-ups from Shenzhen in China to Haifa in Israel, and this is what I learned about deep tech ventures. They focus on fundamental issues, identifying physical constraints of industries not solved for decades. For example, in energy, nuclear fusion; in mobility, air robotaxi. They work as a close hub of emerging technologies. Like synthetic biology, quantum programming, artificial intelligence and many others, they focus on physical product using data and digital platform to accelerate the test-and-run phase. They rely on an ecosystem to accelerate the innovation cycle, including the build-and-test phase. Too many disciplines are necessary to master for one venture to go alone. It is about cooperation, not competition. Deep tech is ultimately transforming discovery into a design and engineering exercise.

So ... why does it matter? It matters because it is happening now, all around us, ongoing. This approach is changing what was once considered impossible into something actively possible today.

Take SpaceX, a deep tech pioneer who disrupted the aerospace industry by producing reusable rockets and spaceships, reducing the cost of going to space by a factor of 10. They achieved this by combining advanced materials and chemicals developed in the last 20 years with vertical integration and the modular approach of modern software engineering.

Or PASQAL, the start-up founded by several students of my friend, Alain Aspect, creatively using fundamental physics combined with software engineering and data science to create an analog quantum processor.

Or take Boston-based Ginkgo Bioworks founded by internet pioneer Tom Knight and a group of MIT scientists. A visit to Ginkgo showed me a lab I had never seen before. I saw a fully automated bioworks lab with the latest robotic techniques, allowing to test thousands of biological designs. They achieved this by building the largest internal metagenomics database of cells, enzymes and genetic programming by combining robotics, protein design, both in microorganism and mammalian cells and data science. They have built a cell programming platform able to create nearly any organism they want by converging science, technology and data and digital platform then to become the Amazon web services of biology, letting start-ups and other companies use their facilities. This is a perfect example of the ecosystem operating.

So right now many of you may be thinking, how do we manage the technological risk? Will investors be ready to play the deep tech game? Yes, there is a technological risk. And developing deep tech requires to rethink our innovation approach. I have seen that four rules govern successful deep tech ventures.

Rule number one: be problem oriented, not technology focused. This is very important. Many deep tech ventures start with a solution in search of a problem. Ginkgo partnered with Bayer to solve the nitrogen fertilizer issue. Nitrogen is the most-used fertilizer in the world today. But it produces three percent of greenhouse gases and it pollutes water. Many start-ups today are trying to solve this issue by applying their solutions. Ginkgo tried to solve it by asking the question in another way: what if instead of producing nitrogen, we create a bacteria that use existing nitrogen to fixate it on the roots of the plants, just like nature does?

Rule number two: it is about combining, intersecting, converging. So you need to bring a cross-disciplinary team early on and play the ecosystem. What does that mean concretely? Take Commonwealth Fusion Systems, an energy venture focusing on nuclear fusion. They achieved their breakthrough in nuclear fusion by combining advances in material and data science that enabled them to do calculation and simulation that was simply not doable a few years back. And they play the ecosystem very well. Corporates like ENI and Equinor have invested early on. Universities like the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Centers are actively collaborating with them. VCs like Breakthrough Energy Ventures and others, are supporting them, and the US government seems interested in working with them.

Rule number three: adopt a design thinking approach powered by deep tech. Identify assumptions early on to be tested to reduce the risk up front. Get to a working prototype as quickly as possible. Anticipate friction points at each stage of the innovation cycle. Use a data and digital platform to reduce the cost of testing them. Lilium Aviation, a deep tech start-up building all-electric air taxi, aiming at solving urban air mobility, has started by developing a two-seater prototype, then a five-seater using real-time data of every flight to design the next version.

Rule number four: adopt a design-to-cost approach. Merging science with engineering requires to have the economics in mind all the time. Zymergen, another synthetic biology lighthouse, whenever they design a product, use a ruthless design-to-cost approach. In the design phase, even before production starts, they look for the right products at the right costs with the right parameters. Zymergen developed Hyaline a transparent, printable circuit for electronics, produced by fermentation. And this biobased film is cheaper and has better properties than the existing one, petroleum-based.

Deep tech is maturing quickly now. In 2019, there were more than 5,000 deep tech ventures fueled by 50 billion dollars of investors and their money. Ventures coming out of research labs have the power to solve our most pressing issues. Think what you would like to grow in your world. Consider how might deep tech help you cultivate that thing, maybe by accelerating a drug development or by eliminating greenhouse gases or perhaps by solving the congestion problem plaguing your city.

Deep tech is an ever-growing opportunity in front of us, waiting to be scaled for this world and more. It is the next chapter in the innovation story, and today I invite all of you to join me in its creation.

"Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world.

Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets.

But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system.

I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis.

In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions.

In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets.

Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization.

Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment.

However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces.

So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them.

The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line.

And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing.

Let me introduce a word we don’t often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs.

But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability.

So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity.

Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet.

There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content.

Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort.

Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets.

Thank you.

"Good morning from Luxembourg, and good afternoon to everyone following this panel in Asia.
I want to use the next few minutes to touch on two topics:
- The future of globalisation after Covid-19
- The changing international financial architecture

Globalisation moves in cycles

Over the past two centuries, globalisation has moved in cycles.
Economic crises have often led to periods of de-globalisation or at least slower globalisation. Covid-19, with many borders closed and the biggest economic crisis in a century, has of course a negative impact on globalisation.
Looking at the trade-to-GDP ratio, the speed of globalisation was extremely fast between the early 1980s and 2008. Trade to GDP almost doubled. An era of “hyperglobalisation”.
This was driven by the digital revolution, falling trade costs, the founding of the WTO, and, in particular, the integration of China into the global economy.
This hyperglobalisation could not continue for very long!
The onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 and the ensuing economic downturn marked a reversal in the trend of high-speed globalisation.
Since 2008, the global trade-to-GDP ratio has remained fairly stable, so the strong rise of the previous decades came to a halt. However, I do not interpret this as systemic de-globalisation, but rather as a normalisation after the very rapid pace of integration previously.
What is particularly striking is that the export-to-GDP ratio of China dropped the last 15 years significantly and this drop explains all of the slowdown in overall globalisation.
China today consumes more of what it produces and exports less, while its domestic supply chains are intensifying.
If there is one factor that could effectively slow down globalisation, it is rising inequality. In advanced economies, some of the rise in inequality comes from globalisation.
This often leads to backlashes against globalisation among the affected populations. As a result, we have seen policy decisions to reduce migration and to impose trade barriers.
In response, governments in advanced economies should provide a better safety nets to those who are negatively affected by globalisation.
In the future, I think globalisation will continue but at a slower pace. Globalisation will survive Covid-19. I do not expect a wave of “de-globalisation” overall as important parts of the world economy, e.g. India and Africa, with their positive demographics, have a huge potential to open up.


A stronger international monetary system

However, we should think how to support globalisation by improving the functioning of the international monetary system.
The US dollar has dominated the international monetary system since the end of World War II. That dominant role of the dollar has at times fuelled global imbalances, excess capital flows and volatility, liquidity shortages and exchange rate volatility, particularly in emerging economies.
A multi-polar currency system would make the world economy less vulnerable to shocks linked to one specific currency. This does not mean replacing the dollar, but rather aiming for a multi-polar system, in which several currencies have a comparable role, including the dollar, euro, and renminbi.
This is not something that can be decided at a summit. It would have to be a market-driven process. But Europe and China can create the pre-conditions to make their currencies more attractive.
In Europe, we are doing that by deepening EMU further, through completing the banking union, creating a Capital Market Union (CMU), strengthening the financial infrastructure, reforming the ESM and creating more safe assets.
In China, Governor Zhou has worked for many years to open up the economy, including the capital account, strengthening and deepening further the domestic financial system while safeguarding fiscal and financial stability.
The results are promising!


Building resilience against crises: regional crisis fighters
Let me mention one other aspect of the international financial architecture: regional cooperation has been increasing.
In recent years, we have seen the creation of new multilateral development banks, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the New Development Bank, established by the BRICS countries.
In addition, we have seen the emergence of new Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs), in particular in Europe and Asia. These are agreements through which groups of countries mutually pledge financial support in times of crisis. The ESM is the Regional Financing Arrangement for the euro area and in recent years we have established a very close cooperation network with the other RFAs.
The firepower of the different RFAs combined is slightly bigger than the lending capacity of the IMF. Well-structured cooperation between the IMF and these regional crisis fighters can generate synergies for resource allocation and surveillance.
To conclude, the pandemic crisis has contributed to the slowing pace of globalisation, as was the cases with previous crises. To make sure there is an upswing once the crisis is over, policymakers can actively develop and deepen regional cooperation and integration. Multilateralism is the way forward to ensure an equitable process of globalisation and enhance social prosperity. Thank you.","Globalisation moves in cycles

"Hello everyone. I’m both delighted and proud to be speaking here today.
Delighted, because it’s fantastic to see such enthusiasm for events like this and that you’ve all taken time out of your busy schedules to focus on and think about how as women, you navigate your future and the future of others, as leaders in the public sector. 
And I’m proud to have been asked to speak because the invitation signals (to me at least!), that perceptions of the Treasury as a haven for men in suits with beige mind sets, has seen a fundamental shift, one that I ascribe directly to our commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion.
Today I’m going to cover 3 things. First, why diversity and inclusion matters. Second, what the Treasury is doing about it. And third, what we can all do about it. 


Why does it matter?

Let’s start. Why does it matter? Why should we care about diversity and inclusion? I used to think that there was such an obvious answer to that that I ignored the question. I was wrong. I’ve discovered that there are many people who don’t believe it matters at all. So we do need to address it.
But let’s start with the economy. It’s in a relatively strong position. We have good levels of growth, price stability, job creation, low unemployment and high labour participation rates.
Our public finances are in good shape; the Crown’s books have returned to surplus and debt is under control.
For the first time in our history, we’re part of the fastest growing region in the world, demand for our products and services is strong and technology is reducing our distance from markets. We’re one of the most diverse nations on earth; there are over 200 ethnicities in Auckland, making it one of the most diverse cities on earth. The World Bank rates us as the best place in the world to do business, our public sector is ranked number one as the least corrupt on the planet according to Transparency international. And the Legatum
Institute has New Zealand ranked first on its Prosperity Index.
It sounds good, and compared to many other countries across the world it is very good.
But of course it reflects the present rather than the future. And what we can see ahead of us are challenges that we need to manage and opportunities that we need to seize. That’s about improving our productivity, looking for value for money in government spending, focusing on citizens, continuing to strengthen our resilience, deepening our international connections and ensuring people have the capabilities and opportunities to live the lives they value.
And that’s a key part of this: people and their capabilities and opportunities. It’s people who make an economy, who create and run its institutions, who innovate and run its businesses, who create its jobs, who pay its taxes, who build its houses and who set its rules.
And half the people in the country are women. Our labour force participation rate for women is currently at 65.3 percent, up from 56.6 percent just twenty years ago; men's participation rate is largely unchanged over the last twenty years, increasing from 74.9 percent to 76 percent. The female unemployment rate is higher than that of men, 5.7 percent compared with 4.8 percent for men.
Women are gaining qualifications at a greater rate than men but their skills are not being translated into greater career opportunities and development in the workplace. Currently many women are educated and trained in areas that do not match where employment is growing. We know for example that STEM industries are in a growth phase yet women make up just 14 percent of the of this sector. Despite an increase in qualifications, women are over-represented in minimum wage jobs. More women than men are currently not in education, employment or training (NEET).
As we look ahead, we know that technology and population ageing will have significant impacts on the shape of the jobs market and the shape of our labour force. These are challenges but they also offer opportunities and, I would argue, for women in particular.


The Treasury

Let’s look at the Treasury. Why do I think that diversity and inclusion matter? Why is there a statement on every floor of our building which says that “we embrace diversity and inclusion as they strengthen us, as individuals and as an organisation”? Again you may think the answer is obvious but it’s important to be clear.
We are the Government’s lead economic and financial adviser. We want to be a worldleading Treasury because we’re ambitious for ourselves and for New Zealand. We see our mission as improving New Zealanders’ living standards. Living standards depend on economic growth and productivity performance but it’s not the whole story. They also depend on things like the quality of our environment, the trust people have in our institutions, and people having the opportunities and skills to live the life they want to lead.
At the heart of the Treasury’s role, at the core of what people expect of us, is the skill of analysis and the exploration of options, the understanding of trade-offs and the presentation of advice to enable choices to be made.
Doing our job well requires knowledge, analytical skills, an understanding of context, and the ability to explain clearly. It depends on the minds – and the hearts – of the people that make up our organisation. And that’s why I believe that to become a world-leading organisation, our advice and services need to be informed by a range of perspectives to enable the fresh thinking and ideas needed to manage the challenges and opportunities facing New Zealand. So I put a premium on diversity of thought.
Being a diverse and inclusive organisation makes us stronger, more resilient and insightful. It helps us to understand the present, better anticipate the challenges and opportunities that may arise in the future and better manage the pace, complexity and crosscutting nature of change. Inclusive diversity in all its forms – ethnic, gender, whatever – is at the core of our continued success as an organisation.


What we’re doing about it

So what are we doing about it?
We’ve benefited from the development of our Living Standards Framework. It wasn’t designed as a diversity and inclusion tool but it’s become a diversity and inclusion enabler. The LSF is a tool that helps to shape and inform our advice to Ministers to promote an economic system that improves the intergenerational wellbeing of New Zealanders. It enables us to think about the aims of our policy objectives – such as improved economic growth – while taking account of the wider impacts that a policy option may have on other factors such as resilience, social cohesion, sustainability and equity. It helps develop policies that increase the opportunities, capabilities and incentives for people to participate productively in economic life.
More specifically on diversity and inclusion itself, you could say the Treasury has been on a journey. A few years ago we had the simple idea to ask our staff how included they felt, what diversity meant to them, how they thought we could become more diverse and what we could start doing to embed a culture of diversity and inclusion at the Treasury. Today, diversity and inclusion is at the heart of our organisational strategy and a defining ambition for me.
I want to mention 5 things that I think have been important to that journey.
We started off by focusing on gender diversity and doing things that now seem dated but were actually quite challenging for the organisation.
For example, we made a big push to facilitate part-time manager roles, to support flexible working and parental leave. I am sure we can do better in the way we design jobs and
tasks. In fact I think employers in general can do a better job in designing jobs and tasks; it’s probably the key to addressing barriers to women in the labour force. For my part, one of the things I’m keen to see is greater job-sharing. It’s hard to organise but it is a way of addressing some of the challenges of part-time working.
A few years ago my executive leadership team decided to address the issue of unconscious bias which is the subtle foe of diversity and inclusion. Without being aware, we can unconsciously exclude people that are different or seen as ‘outsiders’ who don’t ‘fit the mould’. That means excluding different ideas, different perspectives and better understanding and promoting group think. So ELT undertook unconscious bias training, as did our managers and, inevitably, we realised we all had our fair share of biases, conscious and unconscious.
For example, my past – the places I grew up in, the schools I went to, the organisations I’ve worked in, the people I’ve spent time with – makes me a particular type. You can’t undo that but you can recognise and address it.
One of the things we’ve done to address unconscious bias is through the use of blind applications in our recruitment practices. We’ve reformed our graduate recruitment process to reduce unconscious bias and to expand the skills, experiences and qualifications that we value. In particular we broadened our reach through school visits and engaging cultural groups on campuses. And we introduced blind applications which redact personal information such as name, gender, location and school attended, to reduce unconscious bias within the selection process.
These changes are leading to change. In 2007, our graduate intake was evenly split on
gender, but 100% identified as NZ European. The 2017 graduate cohort still has a 50/50 gender representation but it’s more diverse, with a little over one third identifying as being solely NZ European and the balance a mix or other ethnicities. This greater diversity of talent – the leaders of the future – will strengthen us. It makes sense to have the Treasury made up of people that not only have the intellectual horse-power to dig deep into complex issues but also have the ability to see, understand and solve them from a range of perspectives.
We’re also looking hard to ensure that we don’t just stop at ‘diversity’. ‘Inclusion’ is the Siamese twin that translates diversity of thought and experience into insights which can be applied to our work.
Measuring inclusion is harder. Ultimately it’ll be reflected in the strength of our advice. But we’re looking to make sure our practices are inclusive and we’re using surveys to assess how well we’re doing. At the moment, the results are positive: three quarters of Treasury people spoken to recently said that the Treasury was ‘invested’ (or more) in diversity and inclusion compared to a similar number saying we were just ‘interested’ in it a couple of years ago. But we’re far from finished. Ultimately, I want diversity and inclusion to be ‘embedded’. We regularly commission such assessments to understand the progress we’re making and to hold ourselves to account.
We also regularly track and report on the diversity of our workforce and our leadership team. It’s essential if you want to understand where you are and where you want to get to. We’re aiming to maintain at least a 40-60 percent gender balance in our leadership cohort, and to keep within a 45-55 percent range across the organisation as a whole. At the last count, the Treasury’s people were 47 percent female and 53 percent male; the gender balance of people leader roles was 35.6 percent female and 64.4 percent male.
Unlike gender, our ethnic diversity is less representative of the population as a whole. 7.3 percent of our staff identify as Māori which compares to the 14 percent of people in the country who do so. 1.6 percent of our staff identify as Pasifika and 6.8 percent as Asian. We’re aiming for our ethnicity representation to be within plus or minus 5 percentage points of the national working age population.
We’ve got gender and ethnic pay gaps and, like every other agency, we’re also looking at how we can reduce them. Our gender pay gap has fallen over the last 10 years but rose again between 2015 and 2016. At 22.9 percent, it’s a gap that I’m concerned about. We’re looking to understand what’s driving it. One explanation for the recent change is that wehaven’t replaced the talented women in management roles who have left for bigger jobs with other talented women. Our pipeline isn’t flowing consistently enough and we need to work out how to fix that. And as for our ethnic pay gap, well I can’t tell you what that is as we don’t know, not reliably anyway. In fact many agencies couldn’t tell you what their ethnic pay gap is. It’s because we are limited by the data we collect. We need to do better. 
Overall, this is about ensuring that the Treasury is attracting and growing the diversity of people and thinking needed to do the job we want to do.


What we can all do about it

Finally, having told you what the Treasury’s trying to do about diversity and inclusion, I want  to touch on what all of us can do about it.
For those of us in leadership roles, I have 5 suggestions: (1) make sure you understand  your organisation, its strategic context and its desired ‘diversity’ profile; (2) question the  processes and practices within your own organisations. Look with fresh eyes at the systems  you work with and ask whether you are excluding people and ideas. Do some unconscious  bias training; (3) make sure you understand and communicate the business case for  achieving your organisation’s desired ‘diversity profile’. Once you’ve communicated it, do  it again and again and again; (4) look to guide, mentor and support your colleagues. It will  pay off for you, for the women in your organisation, and for your organisation; and (5) talk  to people outside of your organisation about what you’re doing and why. We need everyone  to understand the importance of diversity and inclusion and the opportunities it offers us.  So tell your stakeholders, your friends and your family. 
For those of you not in leadership roles, do the same thing. This has to be a shared  endeavour. Make sure you understand and can communicate the business case for  diversity and inclusion. Bring your ideas to the table, share your experiences, and hold your  leaders to account for growing diversity and inclusion in your organisations.  And for all of you: support, and learn from, each other.


Conclusion

One thing that I have emphasised is making the business case for diversity and inclusion. I’ve deliberately not talked about it being ‘the right thing to do’. While in fact I think that this is the right thing to do, and it may be what some of you think, there are people out there with different values to ours. 
They may disagree with the statement ‘diversity strengthens us’ and some may be shocked at what I’ve said today. In the spirit of diversity and inclusion, we need to be aware of these different values and persuade them of the business case. In my view, we can persuade them that greater diversity and inclusion does matter, that it would make a positive difference to them. And I suggest that we can’t simply argue that our values are better than theirs or assume our own values make a business case. 
The good thing is we don’t need to rest on that. The business case, the evidence, is there. We need to articulate it well and hold our leaders to account for delivering it.
Organisations that reflect the societies they serve are stronger and more successful than those that don’t. New Zealand’s diversity is an asset. I firmly believe that when we work, think, and act to leverage that asset, we’re seizing one of the greatest opportunities of our age.
Be it gender diversity or ethnic diversity, both create diversity of thought. It is diversity that will help us manage the rapidly-changing world around us. But saying it is easier than doing it. It requires leadership, from every one of us. It requires us to inspire, to influence, to challenge, to have the will and to be determined.","Why does Diversity & Inclusion matter?

"In the past year, security strategies and practices have been tested like no other. Rapidly accelerated digital transformations, opportunistic phishing campaigns, discontinuity of information security operations and fnancial constraints are creating the perfect storm in a COVID-19-disrupted world. CISOs who understand these challenges and can pivot their security approach can help their organizations to emerge stronger.

Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (Accenture CTI) has been creating relevant, timely and actionable threat intelligence for more than 20 years. Now, following the acquisitions of Context in March 2020 and Seattle-based Security of Things company, Deja vu Security in June 2019, Accenture Security has gained an additional 20 years' intelligence reporting and deep expertise in the techniques, tools and methods for securing connected devices and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The cyber threat intelligence team, referred to in this report as Accenture CTI, provides IT security and business operations with actionable and relevant decision support

Since our last report in 2019, our cyber threat intelligence and incident response teams have investigated numerous cases of suspected cyber espionage and fnancially-motivated targeting. During these investigations, threat intelligence analysts and incident responders have gained frst-hand visibility of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed by some of the most sophisticated cyber adversaries/

Our track record of experience serves us well as we unravel the changes in cybersecurity threats in the last 12 months. Early in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most businesses across the globe found they needed to shift quickly to remote work—some did so according to a plan, others reacted but not according to their plan, and still more did not even have a plan. Remote work has challenged enterprise security monitoring in numerous ways from the platforms used for communication to the devices people are using and networks on which they transmit data. We have seen an increase in social engineering opportunities as cyberespionage and cybercriminal groups attempt to take advantage of vulnerable employees unfamiliar with managing their technology environments. The worldwide, economic and business disruptions have put tremendous fnancial challenges on businesses. Those pressures inevitably fow down to information security operations to maintain or increase coverage under ever-tighter budgetary constraints.

Sophisticated threat actors are employing new TTPs to help achieve their long-standing objectives of regime survival, economic acceleration, military superiority, information operations and cyber espionage. As we detail later in this report, our threat intelligence analysts have seen adversaries develop new implants for use against Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange environments, and more sophisticated command and control methods that attempt to disrupt detection efforts through internal proxy mechanisms.

Criminals will still work to monetize access to data or networks, perhaps more frequently than before as the economy continues to be vulnerable. As we have seen this year, supply chain compromise and off-the-shelf tools could feature heavily, as could ongoing evidence of custom tools designed to evade defenses

Ransomware has increased in popularity among bad actors, as data theft increases the pressures on victims. With game-changing ransomware attacks, such as the Maze threat, the name-and-shame technique has gained momentum that calls into question the cost versus disruption debate

In such a climate, and with organizations attempting to stabilize their current operations, CISOs should put the right controls in place to create a safe and secure environment. Accenture has identified four elements of adaptive security that can help: a secure mindset, secure network access, secure work environments and secure collaboration. CISOs should engage with business leaders to plan, prepare and practice for greater cybersecurity resilience, backed by the right resources and investments. Accenture believes a multi-dimensional crisis management strategy, with many work streams and teams that collaborate closely, often on a daily basis, is the way to help achieve cybersecurity resilience—and can help to protect enterprises from harm.

Read on to take a deeper dive into the fve frontline trends identifed in 2020. These insights can enhance the work of security teams and put security technology investments, security processes and the business strategy on a frm footing to help achieve the desired level of cyber resilience","Cybersecurity & COVID-19

"Without further ado, I'm going to start introducing our panellists. First, we have Katherine Chong. Product Lead (Stealth); Mareike Bonitz, Senior Product Manager at Worksome; Komal Narwani, Chief Marketing and Product Design Officer, Weavit; and Ujjwal Trivedi Sr. Director of Products, WorkInSync. Thank you so much for joining all of us today everybody. I will pass it over to Ujjwal, who will be our moderator for this panel. Take it away. Sure.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
Hi, everyone. I've got a bunch of questions that I thought would make sense for the topic that we have today. I will be asking those in the next 30 minutes, and I would hope you will have a lot of questions on how to become a better mentor and how to become a better mentee. Please feel free to put them on the slideshow. So jumping right in. This question is for everyone, and we will start with Katherine. Why are you a mentor?

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
Personally for me, my whole life has been centred around service. When it came down to last year I took a sabbatical, I finally had time to do a lot of the things that I couldn't do when I was working full time. The first thing I turned to was mentorship because it just came to me naturally. My first exposure was ADPlist, and I thought that seemed like something to keep myself busy with when I transitioned from full time work to no work.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
I became a mentor by accident. I have a good friend Dahlia, who started a marketing mentorship initiative in Copenhagen where I live and work. She said I should sign up, just to have someone in the product marketing sphere. I said tht I will support her initiative. I didn't really expect anything, and also wondering what I could ever teach people in the position that I'm at. But in the end, it was the best experience. I definitely found right people, and I think maybe I learned more than them in some parts. It definitely gave me a completely new outlook on the profession and how do you teach people about products and how you work.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
In 2018, I went through a bit of a difficult time in my career path. At that point in time, I was looking for some guidance, and I had a mentor at that point. I think it was a really rewarding experience that he offered me. There are tons of very successful people out there. It's not really about the position that you have, or you know how much you've achieved materially – but the fact that you offer a different perspective to somebody when they need it, and I think it was that that pushed me a little bit more into becoming a mentor, because it's both rewarding and fulfilling to get a different perspective, but also to give one as well.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
Exploring new perspectives is definitely a theme that's coming out from everyone's answers, and of course giving back. So diving deeper into mentorship, what skills do you think are required to become a great mentor?

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
Not that it's competition in any way but more so, I feel like diversity of experience is a huge thing, because you never know who you're going to speak to on the other side of the call. Another one that is very commonly shared by most design thinkers is empathy – the fact that you can kind of be non-judgmental to the person you're speaking to. It's always easier said than done, because we're hard on ourselves, but you can't be like that with the person you're speaking to. You have to have this intrinsic desire to give back – you're giving your time, which means it has to be genuine in some way.

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
Another thing I feel is an absolute skill that all mentors need is this on top of empathy is to call out curiosity. So I found very interestingly, even though I'm a product manager, my first batch of calls were all with product designers. What was very interesting was they actually intentionally booked with a product manager, because they want to learn about the other side. So I had to bring a lot of curiosity in terms of like, there's a reason why they were booking with me and it really did need a lot of perspective from the product manager, and having that curiosity for them and their environment was very fascinating and a great learning point for me as well. So that is also a really big skill that mentors can bring into their sessions with any mentee, and you can actually do this regardless of your security level.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
Curiosity, empathy, exposure, and I will just add that being a great listener. Otherwise, you just get bogged down with a lot of soft hints at the problems that people have. If you just listen to their words, or what they're saying, you just kind of might miss out on the real problem that is one level beneath the surface. So yeah, the ability to listen between the lines.

Next up, how do you prepare for a mentoring call?

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
So one of the things I did during my sabbatical which I found actually really helpful was that I started practising meditation. Meditation taught me a very important skill, which was how to be a lot more present inside the moment. That was particularly helpful especially when I’m working on several projects, which embodies that concept of context switching for product managers we do a lot of, but it's how to actually be there. And I learned how to do that better. And that's really, for me, very critical. Going back to your point about listening, listening was really just about what they were saying rather than what they meant. And I found that practising meditation and being more present helped me really hear what's actually happening versus what they're actually saying. I found for me, most of my mentorship calls actually completely derail from the agenda that the mentee has set. The best sessions never ended up with those 10 questions. We ended up talking about something that's actually happening in their life that's causing them to even book a call with me. So that's what I found helps me prepare the best – which is just to start actually with without much of any agenda, but to make sure that I'm mentally in a space where I can be the best mentor I can be.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
Spinning off on that, I don't prepare much. Of course, I will look at the profile of the person and maybe even their LinkedIn profile to see their experience and where I can help, but I think there's really not much to it. Also, other skills that we mentioned before are also great skills for a Product Manager. So I think it might also be very natural for us in the field to do this, to listen and try to solve problems that we haven't really heard of before. So in that sense, I can just say everyone can start straight away because probably there's not much preparation to do.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
I think it's no surprise that a design mentorship platform is so successful, because like Mereike just said, a lot of the same traits that I mean you share amongst designers, that you have to use in your day to day work. But I think what Katherine said is very true: You have to put yourself in a different headspace before you hop on a call. Because it's not about you, it's about that other person. We all have crappy days, and sometimes a mentorship call pops up in the middle of the day – you're not always feeling like a conversation, so it's really changing your mindset.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
One of the things that I like to do and that has worked for me is to ask them some good questions. I look at their profile and I asked them what they are struggling with, what questions do they have, and what is their agenda? I try to ask them a few good questions, and I think in the first 5-10 minutes, if you ask them the right questions, that sets the agenda really, really well. Sometimes the mentoring call, gets extended and goes beyond the agenda, and it just brings out the real issues and helps us talk about the real solutions.
Sometimes the session can lead to conflict, e.g. you meet someone very depressed or negative. How do you help them get into a positive zone? Has that happened to you?

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
I can talk about some, the most powerful changes I experienced as a mentee when I was on a mentorship conversation. And it was when I got to see myself through a mirror-like experience, and I felt so much encouragement, not because the individual was cheerleading me or trying to be my cheerleader. I actually saw how hard I was on myself. So whenever I encounter a mentee who's particularly being hard on themselves and can't get to a point where they can motivate themselves, I often try to get them to see themselves through another lens as if they were another person and that encouragement is actually a lot more powerful than anything I could say. So I found for me, whenever I just call out that type of behaviour explicitly, that's really when they see it the most. That happened to me when I was on a mentorship call. My mentor said to me, you get 10/10 for vulnerability for sharing that with me, but you get 0/10 because you're so hard on yourself. And it wasn't until he called it out explicitly that I realised, why am I so hard on myself? Clearly, it hasn't worked for me before, because I'm not getting the result I was looking for, so why is it going to continue working if I keep going that way? And for me, I need to be smacked right in the face with that answer to see it for myself. And I'm like, wow. And that was really when I developed a lot more empathy for myself. That's something that I want to bring into all the mentorship calls I have, which is that mentees need to have a lot more empathy for themselves in those calls. So that's something that I've tried to do whenever I experienced a mentee who's having a particularly tough time.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
Another thing is I feel that energy is quite contagious. So when you're on a call with somebody, you can't tell somebody to be in a positive mindset if you're not in one yourself – it just feels artificial. It's very normal that you're not going to be in a positive headspace all day, every day, so it's just about being a little bit more accepting of yourself and the state that you're in.
In the beginning, when I had a mentor it was really helpful to just have another perspective, and I think having a consistency and having a stable energy that is positive but not overly positive – it depends on everyone's learning style – but also be more actionable and saying, Okay, let's be real here: you must have gotten yourself out of this kind of situation at some point in the past. Why don't we try and unpack some of those strategies and use them again? If you've done it once before, I think you can do it again.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
Most of the stuff I learned is from failure and I think that's something that happens in product over and over again. So I usually say just go out, try and see where it leads to. I can see that there's like a huge competition in the field already. And people are sometimes not daring to try because they lack experience and/or fear competition, especially  for people who are just transitioning into product management. I think it's important to also find out yourself, what is it that you like so much about the job? What are the skills that you think you can bring in? I try to see the uniqueness and the personality of that person rather than just you know, doing the job and having to fulfil these 10 criteria that I listed to do it? So I always try to be open and encourage people just to try it out, because usually, even if you fail, there's a lot of learning on the way.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
I get a sense that we are getting really philosophical here, but that's what mentoring is about. I would want each of you to walk us through, what is that one thing that you've gotten out of being a mentor? So, what's in it for you? What are you deriving? What keeps you motivated about being a mentor? T

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
It's hard to find that one thing, but I think it's a lot about connections. So I think that's also where ADPlist comes in – I don't think I've ever had access to such an international crowd that shares so many of my interests and passions when it comes to work. I've just met amazing people that I've learned from quite a lot, and being able to solve a lot of the you know, these problems on the sides, which is something that I also love about my job in general, has been super rewarding for me.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
I'm gonna piggyback on that. Problem solving is something I'm very drawn to – I'm drawn to challenging situations for some reason. But moreover, what's very rewarding is if you speak to somebody, even if you speak to one person and the outcome is them feeling more confident and feeling more empowered – that's super rewarding. And it's something you can't really replace with getting paid for anything, to be honest.

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
I have a greater empathy for myself, but I'll tell you another very selfish reason why I do mentorship. I often get mentees who have had very similar experiences to me. So it's not to say that I've solved every product problem that I've encountered in my life. Often with some of these mentees, though, especially the ones that are a little bit further in their career, they often have problems that I have problems with, and that I've never fully resolved. What was interesting, we were both sitting there trying to solve that problem where I was getting a little bit of PTSD. I'm like, this is like the same problem I had in my last workplace. We were both kind of like the read putting our minds together towards constructively working towards that problem. And then I realised that for me, I just learned something like that's how I could have revisited that problem. So if I ever encounter that again, this is how I would strategically get around that. Through mentorship, I actually improve a lot of my mental frameworks, and also being able to call out my mental biases. And I found that very rewarding because it's something that I can talk about and teach now.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
I have one last question for everyone. What is your advice to all the mentees listening here? How can they make the best of this platform or any platform? How can they make the best when they approach mentors as a mentee?

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
Advice for mentees is firstly with some level of experience, you never know, you could also lend a helping hand to somebody else. That's one thing. There's like no levelling or elitism involved in this. And the second is that if you have 30 minutes and you are using your time and somebody else's time to have a more constructive outcome, then try to really apply the stuff that you talk about rather than just talking about it, so you get the best ROI on your time spent.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
Yes, I think for the mentee, it's important to be prepared and know what's the purpose of you reaching out. When I do some research, I sometimes have my three big questions, and I think that it's good to have, because otherwise it might become a very general conversation, which might not be the best outcome of this. Secondly, find the right mentor. Spend a little bit more time looking who's the person that could be the best candidate, instead of just reaching out.

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
My advice for mentees is a little bit more of a tactical one, but it's the follow through. Often times, mentees book calls with us for 30 minutes and in my experience, there are some mentees that will work more calls with you or even just do like a simple message follow up. I found through my experience, the ones to actually follow up and say I tried that thing, or really consciously took your advice to heart,  experienced better outcomes. I'm not talking about that exact problem that they necessarily had. It's a bit of their overall journey – I've seen people completely change their career trajectory just because they were mindfully applying that. So I would say for a lot of mentees who are on this platform, one of the best things you could do for yourself is actually treat the treat that time that you have with the mentor as a gift, and return it in one way or another effort, whether that be repeated calls or following through and letting them know like what the result was, or what your thoughts were after the session.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
There are few mentees who would be excited about after the call, and then you not never see them again. And then there are a few who will reach out on different other mediums like LinkedIn and Twitter, and they will tell you, I followed your advice and this happened. This has helped and and now I'm on to the next thing. That feels so great.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
We are towards the end. What is one secret weapon that you have as a product manager that you want to tell the world today?

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
One of the things I wanted to practice the art of was the art of conversation – being able to walk into like a coffee shop and talk to strangers without any agenda at all. That has been the biggest moment in my career because it's helped me so much in terms of customer discovery that I learned, because now that I'm going back into a product, I'm like, wow, this is so much fun.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
I would say reading the room. When you're speaking to stakeholders, or you're speaking to other people, it's very helpful sometimes because you know what to avoid and how to have the conversations. But it's also a bit of a flaw sometimes because you can be wrong, and that's when you have to check yourself if you have a bias right now kicking in.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
All of us have different data, different exposure, and different biases. That's so true for mentors and so tue for us when we are mentees, as well as when we get mentees talking to us, to show them what what is the gap and what is the bias and then letting them decide.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
Yes, for me it's staying humble. And sometimes you're the experts in the room. And you're basically the only person who knows that because sometimes you just have to let other people talk and let them get to that realisation themselves – just also to be a little bit more strategic. But I think just being vulnerable and staying humble is also very important.","Why mentorship?

"The foundation is what we call the organisation principles. Who are you? If you had to describe
yourself as a person, you'd say, “I’m dynamic”, “I love spending time with people”, “I value
relationships”, etc. What are the same set of statements for you as a company? Do you guys have a
written down, well-articulated simple way of describing what you stand for as a company and why you
exist? That's what the organisation principles are. The foundation is basically, Who am I? Why do I
exist? Not just a series of statements, but something written down. You can call it a company constitution,
or a company manifesto, but you have it written down in a way that everyone understands. So that's
the foundation. If the new team member who joined you last month doesn't know what this means, then
you're already in trouble.

Then, there are three pillars. The first one is basically how you work - what is your way of working as a
company? The second pillar is your HR policies and practices - how do you deal with people, and how
do you deal with each other? And the third is the people component itself - how inspirational are you
as a leader? How inspirational are your managers, and how well are your teams working together?
What's the effectiveness of how teams work together? These are the three pillars that support the
overall culture.

There are several components to how you work: decision making and alignment tend to be big topics,
particularly as you scale. As a small team, when you make decisions, you can announce it in your
weekly all-hands and everyone gets it very quickly, and moves on. As you start getting a bit bigger,
people start wondering, “Why did you take that decision?”, “No one explained it to me. I'm lost and
confused.” That happens very, very frequently. And Alignment is not just about taking decisions, but
rather hearing everyone’s points of view, and whether everyone truly believes in where you’re going.
These are some of the elements that add up to the way of working for you as a company. What you
have to think about is whether we have each of these operational practices working well for us:
alignment, decision-making, collaboration, communication, impact, and innovation.

In earlier-stage companies fewer than 100 people, career development is a non-issue. No one seems to
care, they are just so busy having impact, and having fun. But the moment you cross 100-150 people,
they start showing up on the radar all over the place. “Where am I going?”, “What's my next
promotion?”, “What's going to happen to me?” - all that starts becoming important. Hiring which is
really having a solid way to make sure you hire people that fit well with your company. Policies,
particularly things like reward , ESOPs, whether people understand what you're doing and why. A lot
of startups have very confused communication around basic health insurance, ESOP, rewards, and that
starts to matter. And the one that irritates most people from the early stage to late stage, and never
seems to go away, is your performance management system. How will people be assessed in a fair
manner? How will you get feedback and how will people progress through their careers? This is
something that is broken almost for all companies in the startup ecosystem, and what we need to worry
about. This is what adds up to HR policies and practices.

The final piece is around inspirational leadership. For many of you, a lot of this will be about you,
yourself, and what is your own personal manager NPS, and as you get a bit bigger, how inspirational
and effective your managers are.

These are the three pillars, and all of this - the foundation plus three pillars - is what adds up to that
overall NPS score you have as a company","How you work
