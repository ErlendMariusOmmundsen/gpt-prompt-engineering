"Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away. Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was ""satisfactory,"" I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best? How would I know what I was doing differently? Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10. We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14. The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. Now, they rank number one across the board, in reading, math and science, and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups, where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask, why is a system like this so important? It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact, there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like? Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, ""Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"" ""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. (Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer, and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan, things you cannot convey in a standard, things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend. I'll see you later. [Every classroom could look like that] (Applause) Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable, but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process, if they collect video in their own classrooms, and they pick the lessons they want to submit, a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. (Applause)","Teaching and systematic feedback

"Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it all wrong in many ways. That's what I want to talk to you about today. But first, let's talk about what AI can do. So in the last decade, we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see, understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see, now they can see. You can imagine this has had a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. So let's look at a couple of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding, keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets the treatment that they need. So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving some of these difficult problems that has really shone in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot of computational power to make neural networks able to really sing, and in the last 15 years, we've been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled all this progress. But at the same time, I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want to talk to you about at the end of the talk. First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very beginning of computing, people have wanted to be able to build computers that could see, understand language, understand speech. The earliest approaches to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code all the algorithms that you need to accomplish those difficult tasks, and it just turned out to not work very well. But in the last 15 years, a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different problem spaces all at once: neural networks. So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties of your real neurons. An individual neuron in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together to learn complicated things. So how do we actually learn in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained to do really complicated things, like translate from one language to another, detect what kind of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. (Laughter) I felt maybe we just needed more compute power. And the University of Minnesota had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we've got to be able to do great things with this. But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress of Moore's law, we actually started to have that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. (Laughter) But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech recognition for your phone, improved understanding of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic information to improve maps, and so on. Around that time, we also got excited about how we could build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits, you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the algorithms are generally composed of different sequences of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it for a lot of other things. And if you build such things, people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie maybe didn't realize, but they were competing against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most neural networks today are trained to do one thing, and one thing only. You train it for a particular task that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights with random values, apply lots of computation to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you're lucky, you end up with a model that is really good at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different tasks you care about. But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that in learning this new skill. Computers can work the same way, but they don't today. If you train a neural network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting your entire education every time you try to do something new. That's crazy, right? So instead, I think we can and should be training multitask models that can do thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first thing comes along, we can leverage the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted with some new problem, you quickly identify the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful in solving that problem. Second problem is that most of our models today deal with only a single modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs, like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points, as well as images, text and video. The third problem is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated for every task, for every example that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains are good at different things, and we're continuously calling upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. (Laughter) AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks, we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling upon the parts that we need for any given task. So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models, use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant bits as we need them. We've been building a system that enables these kinds of approaches, and we've been calling the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally add new tasks, and it can deal with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. But I also wanted to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. For example, if we're going to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. So in 2018, Google published this set of AI principles by which we think about developing these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful and important framing for how to think about these deep and complex questions about how we should be using AI in society. We continue to update these as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles are active areas of research -- super important area. Moving from single-purpose systems that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose intelligent systems that have a deeper understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems humanity faces. For example, we'll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn in new and better ways; we'll be able to tackle really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. So I've seen a lot of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that, better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years that excites you? Jeff Dean: I think the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training separate models for everything means you need lots of data about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying to learn everything about the world and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. CA: You can do a form of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably little seeding. JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing 10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying unintended consequences possible, from that? JD: I think it depends on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful about how you consider applications. CA: One of the things people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward into the future aspects of the world as it is that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real, at the heart of your day-to-day? JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these related research issues, because many of those things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly, weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules about how you hold off, church-state wall between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. JD: Yeah, our research group does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group, the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration, but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more than 1,000 papers last year in different topics, including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models are developed safely and responsibly. CA: It feels like we're at a time when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever a moment to really show the world that this is being done to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. JD: Indeed. CA: It's very good to hear you come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. JD: Thank you. (Applause)","What caused the recent progress of AI systems?

"Buildings are not only what they seem. They aren't just inert structures to live and work in. They're connected to the energy system. And this makes buildings an essential element of the efforts to decarbonize our world. Today, I want to talk about changing our thinking around the role of buildings in the energy system and how they can transform to bring us closer to our climate targets. But first, I want to take you to where I grew up, in this building in a mid-sized city in Russia. To me, it looked [like] just a great concrete box, like many others. There are indeed numerous buildings like this across Europe and Central Asia, inherited from Soviet times. They were built quickly to house as many people as possible, without much consideration for their design, comfort and energy usage. This is true of many, many buildings across the world. Nondescript housing and office boxes, built fast and cheap, and all connected to the energy system. I live in Paris now, and though buildings there look much nicer, from the perspective of energy, issues are similar. High energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels and high energy costs, driven even higher by the current energy crisis. In Paris, I work with International Energy Agency, and we advise governments across the world on various energy issues. And for that, we look at data a lot. And our data shows that at the global scale, buildings are responsible for about one third of total energy consumption and energy- and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. In Europe, for example, 90 percent of buildings that exist today will still be standing and in use by 2050. We are also building more new buildings. Our data shows that the global floor area is expected to increase by 75 percent by mid-century. This is equivalent to adding an area the size of Paris every week for the next 30 years. If this happens with energy consumption patterns of today, this alone will make it very difficult to achieve our climate targets. Fortunately, we do have solutions available to reduce direct emissions from buildings by more than 95 percent by 2050. And for this, we need three things: efficiency, electrification and decarbonization. Energy efficiency must come first. And in buildings, it should be improved in two ways. First, through improving energy efficiency of the building envelope with better materials, design solutions, insulation of walls, roofs, basements, energy-efficient windows. Second, through improving energy efficiency of all appliances and equipment used in building -- for space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, working and entertainment. However, energy efficiency, as they say, takes a village. Many forces and interests interact during construction and renovation of a building. The developers, the owners, the regulators, the architects, the suppliers of technologies, the market itself exerting price pressure. All these need to be aligned. And it all starts with the governments mandating minimum energy efficiency requirements through their regulation, putting the right incentives in place and providing clear information tools. Building energy codes, standards and labeling for appliances and equipment, as well as buildings, are among the most effective instruments at our disposal -- if they're enforced well and together with other supporting mechanisms. Energy efficiency in buildings also depends on us as consumers, the choices we make, buildings we decide to live in, appliances and devices we buy and the way we use them at home or our workplaces. So what is the result of improving energy efficiency? Significant energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, lower energy bills and improved comfort, productivity and health of people living in them. The second thing we need is a massive shift towards electricity. And of course I mean clean, decarbonized electricity produced from solar, wind and other low-carbon sources. If we look at Europe, for instance, more than 40 percent of households rely on natural gas for space heating and cooking. To complicate matters, 40 percent of all gas consumed in Europe last year was imported from Russia. So there is a climate imperative, but also a strong geopolitical and energy security imperative to electrify and decarbonize our buildings and make them as efficient as possible. This doesn't only mean replacing energy supply from a gas pipeline with energy supply from an electric line. And here I reach back to my opening point. We need to look at buildings differently. Not only as great concrete boxes, as I used to do, but as potential active players in the energy system. So how can we make buildings active? Through installing efficient and low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, energy storage, making use of smart and digital tools. All technologies we already have, and in many cases their costs are decreasing. Let me introduce a word we don't often hear: “prosumer.” Think of a building not only as a consumer of energy, but as prosumer, both consuming and producing. Most buildings can produce at least part of the energy they need. In many cases, they can produce more. Such buildings already exist in many parts of the world. In Switzerland, for example, there is even a single family house that produces 800 percent of the energy it needs. But still, we have a long way to go to make them a common practice. Besides challenges with improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies, another obstacle is that our electricity networks, or grids, as we call them, were designed to operate with large centralized sources of generation, like power plants. And their design hasn't changed much over the past century. So increasing decentralized or distributed, smaller-scale generation, especially from variable renewable sources like solar and wind, can really put pressure on existing electricity grids and challenge their stability. So we also need to rethink the way our entire electricity system is designed. Smart grids can communicate to a building through software algorithms and smart controls, and, for example, send a signal to a connected device, such as your heating system, to temporarily stop or reduce energy use, or, if possible, shift it to the time when electricity is more available, cleaner or cheaper. This can really improve the robustness of the electricity network and help to avoid, for example, rolling blackouts, which are becoming more common, while consumers can get paid for it. If you have an electric car and you keep it plugged in for a prolonged period of time, a smart charger can help to find the best time to charge it, depending on the information from the grid. This can help save you money and support the electricity system. It gets even more interesting. Electric cars are essentially batteries on wheels, so they can also be used as energy storage and dispatch electricity to the home or to the grid at the time of need. A building itself can be used to store energy for some time, but you need to make it energy-efficient first. Potentially you can also get paid for making your energy storage available for electricity system to store renewable electricity when there is too much of it, for example, when there is a lot of sunshine or wind, but demand is not high enough to use it all. It's almost like renting your spare bedroom on Airbnb, just for hosting electricity. Now imagine a future with many, many buildings, solar panels, electric cars, energy storage, other distributed devices, drawing electricity from the grid and supplying electricity back to it. Obviously we would need a way to manage all this data efficiently and in real time, make sure that devices interact well with each other and are able to communicate to the grid and optimize electricity demand and supply for the entire system. Virtual power plants, digital and intelligent platforms can do just that. They can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage and manage complex interactions. Virtual power plants can also facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. Imagine that electricity that your building produced, for example, from solar panels, but you don't need at the moment, you can sell directly to another building that needs it via an online platform. A project like this has been running already for several years in one of the districts in Bangkok and is showing benefits to the consumers, the grid and the planet. There are other pilot projects like this in different countries, but for them to scale, our policy frameworks and electricity market design need to undergo substantial changes. Our buildings need to become more efficient and grids need to evolve into smarter managers of distributed energy resources. It's a dramatic shift. It's like going from all-television world with a single broadcaster to a new, connected world where everyone can generate and share their own content. Remember that building I grew up in? You might be surprised, but during winter, it would often get too hot inside the apartment, even if it was -30 outside. It was because of highly inefficient central heating system, which we couldn't control or do anything about. So we did this. Yes. We had to open the windows to get some fresh air and more comfort. Now I want to take you to my current flat in Paris, where I have tiny but very smart boxes attached to my electric heaters, which can automatically turn them on and off, maintaining comfortable temperatures, lowering my energy bills and providing flexibility to the grid. And I can control all that on my smartphone. The technologies -- that we have. Now we need the policies, the investments, the will -- and a new way to look at buildings not just passive users of energy, but as active players in the energy system. Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targets. Thank you.

"When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work in the big tech companies. And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write the future. But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him. I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store. The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them. What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending on social media. Or for product placement, why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth. Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system. But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes on social media, is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do. You have to write pages and pages of code. And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory. And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using. Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms are coming along, and some of them are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems. I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take advantage of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create tremendous wealth. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future. Thank you very much.

"Good morning from Luxembourg, and good afternoon to everyone following this panel in Asia.
I want to use the next few minutes to touch on two topics:
- The future of globalisation after Covid-19
- The changing international financial architecture

Globalisation moves in cycles

Over the past two centuries, globalisation has moved in cycles.
Economic crises have often led to periods of de-globalisation or at least slower globalisation. Covid-19, with many borders closed and the biggest economic crisis in a century, has of course a negative impact on globalisation.
Looking at the trade-to-GDP ratio, the speed of globalisation was extremely fast between the early 1980s and 2008. Trade to GDP almost doubled. An era of “hyperglobalisation”.
This was driven by the digital revolution, falling trade costs, the founding of the WTO, and, in particular, the integration of China into the global economy.
This hyperglobalisation could not continue for very long!
The onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 and the ensuing economic downturn marked a reversal in the trend of high-speed globalisation.
Since 2008, the global trade-to-GDP ratio has remained fairly stable, so the strong rise of the previous decades came to a halt. However, I do not interpret this as systemic de-globalisation, but rather as a normalisation after the very rapid pace of integration previously.
What is particularly striking is that the export-to-GDP ratio of China dropped the last 15 years significantly and this drop explains all of the slowdown in overall globalisation.
China today consumes more of what it produces and exports less, while its domestic supply chains are intensifying.
If there is one factor that could effectively slow down globalisation, it is rising inequality. In advanced economies, some of the rise in inequality comes from globalisation.
This often leads to backlashes against globalisation among the affected populations. As a result, we have seen policy decisions to reduce migration and to impose trade barriers.
In response, governments in advanced economies should provide a better safety nets to those who are negatively affected by globalisation.
In the future, I think globalisation will continue but at a slower pace. Globalisation will survive Covid-19. I do not expect a wave of “de-globalisation” overall as important parts of the world economy, e.g. India and Africa, with their positive demographics, have a huge potential to open up.


A stronger international monetary system

However, we should think how to support globalisation by improving the functioning of the international monetary system.
The US dollar has dominated the international monetary system since the end of World War II. That dominant role of the dollar has at times fuelled global imbalances, excess capital flows and volatility, liquidity shortages and exchange rate volatility, particularly in emerging economies.
A multi-polar currency system would make the world economy less vulnerable to shocks linked to one specific currency. This does not mean replacing the dollar, but rather aiming for a multi-polar system, in which several currencies have a comparable role, including the dollar, euro, and renminbi.
This is not something that can be decided at a summit. It would have to be a market-driven process. But Europe and China can create the pre-conditions to make their currencies more attractive.
In Europe, we are doing that by deepening EMU further, through completing the banking union, creating a Capital Market Union (CMU), strengthening the financial infrastructure, reforming the ESM and creating more safe assets.
In China, Governor Zhou has worked for many years to open up the economy, including the capital account, strengthening and deepening further the domestic financial system while safeguarding fiscal and financial stability.
The results are promising!


Building resilience against crises: regional crisis fighters
Let me mention one other aspect of the international financial architecture: regional cooperation has been increasing.
In recent years, we have seen the creation of new multilateral development banks, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the New Development Bank, established by the BRICS countries.
In addition, we have seen the emergence of new Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs), in particular in Europe and Asia. These are agreements through which groups of countries mutually pledge financial support in times of crisis. The ESM is the Regional Financing Arrangement for the euro area and in recent years we have established a very close cooperation network with the other RFAs.
The firepower of the different RFAs combined is slightly bigger than the lending capacity of the IMF. Well-structured cooperation between the IMF and these regional crisis fighters can generate synergies for resource allocation and surveillance.
To conclude, the pandemic crisis has contributed to the slowing pace of globalisation, as was the cases with previous crises. To make sure there is an upswing once the crisis is over, policymakers can actively develop and deepen regional cooperation and integration. Multilateralism is the way forward to ensure an equitable process of globalisation and enhance social prosperity. Thank you.","Globalisation moves in cycles

"Hello everyone. I'm both delighted and proud to be speaking here today.
Delighted, because it's fantastic to see such enthusiasm for events like this and that you've all taken time out of your busy schedules to focus on and think about how as women, you navigate your future and the future of others, as leaders in the public sector. 
And I'm proud to have been asked to speak because the invitation signals (to me at least!), that perceptions of the Treasury as a haven for men in suits with beige mind sets, has seen a fundamental shift, one that I ascribe directly to our commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion.
Today I'm going to cover 3 things. First, why diversity and inclusion matters. Second, what the Treasury is doing about it. And third, what we can all do about it. 


Why does it matter?

Let's start. Why does it matter? Why should we care about diversity and inclusion? I used to think that there was such an obvious answer to that that I ignored the question. I was wrong. I've discovered that there are many people who don't believe it matters at all. So we do need to address it.
But let's start with the economy. It's in a relatively strong position. We have good levels of growth, price stability, job creation, low unemployment and high labour participation rates.
Our public finances are in good shape; the Crown's books have returned to surplus and debt is under control.
For the first time in our history, we're part of the fastest growing region in the world, demand for our products and services is strong and technology is reducing our distance from markets. We're one of the most diverse nations on earth; there are over 200 ethnicities in Auckland, making it one of the most diverse cities on earth. The World Bank rates us as the best place in the world to do business, our public sector is ranked number one as the least corrupt on the planet according to Transparency international. And the Legatum
Institute has New Zealand ranked first on its Prosperity Index.
It sounds good, and compared to many other countries across the world it is very good.
But of course it reflects the present rather than the future. And what we can see ahead of us are challenges that we need to manage and opportunities that we need to seize. That's about improving our productivity, looking for value for money in government spending, focusing on citizens, continuing to strengthen our resilience, deepening our international connections and ensuring people have the capabilities and opportunities to live the lives they value.
And that's a key part of this: people and their capabilities and opportunities. It's people who make an economy, who create and run its institutions, who innovate and run its businesses, who create its jobs, who pay its taxes, who build its houses and who set its rules.
And half the people in the country are women. Our labour force participation rate for women is currently at 65.3 percent, up from 56.6 percent just twenty years ago; men's participation rate is largely unchanged over the last twenty years, increasing from 74.9 percent to 76 percent. The female unemployment rate is higher than that of men, 5.7 percent compared with 4.8 percent for men.
Women are gaining qualifications at a greater rate than men but their skills are not being translated into greater career opportunities and development in the workplace. Currently many women are educated and trained in areas that do not match where employment is growing. We know for example that STEM industries are in a growth phase yet women make up just 14 percent of the of this sector. Despite an increase in qualifications, women are over-represented in minimum wage jobs. More women than men are currently not in education, employment or training (NEET).
As we look ahead, we know that technology and population ageing will have significant impacts on the shape of the jobs market and the shape of our labour force. These are challenges but they also offer opportunities and, I would argue, for women in particular.


The Treasury

Let's look at the Treasury. Why do I think that diversity and inclusion matter? Why is there a statement on every floor of our building which says that “we embrace diversity and inclusion as they strengthen us, as individuals and as an organisation”? Again you may think the answer is obvious but it's important to be clear.
We are the Government's lead economic and financial adviser. We want to be a worldleading Treasury because we're ambitious for ourselves and for New Zealand. We see our mission as improving New Zealanders' living standards. Living standards depend on economic growth and productivity performance but it's not the whole story. They also depend on things like the quality of our environment, the trust people have in our institutions, and people having the opportunities and skills to live the life they want to lead.
At the heart of the Treasury's role, at the core of what people expect of us, is the skill of analysis and the exploration of options, the understanding of trade-offs and the presentation of advice to enable choices to be made.
Doing our job well requires knowledge, analytical skills, an understanding of context, and the ability to explain clearly. It depends on the minds – and the hearts – of the people that make up our organisation. And that's why I believe that to become a world-leading organisation, our advice and services need to be informed by a range of perspectives to enable the fresh thinking and ideas needed to manage the challenges and opportunities facing New Zealand. So I put a premium on diversity of thought.
Being a diverse and inclusive organisation makes us stronger, more resilient and insightful. It helps us to understand the present, better anticipate the challenges and opportunities that may arise in the future and better manage the pace, complexity and crosscutting nature of change. Inclusive diversity in all its forms – ethnic, gender, whatever – is at the core of our continued success as an organisation.


What we're doing about it

So what are we doing about it?
We've benefited from the development of our Living Standards Framework. It wasn't designed as a diversity and inclusion tool but it's become a diversity and inclusion enabler. The LSF is a tool that helps to shape and inform our advice to Ministers to promote an economic system that improves the intergenerational wellbeing of New Zealanders. It enables us to think about the aims of our policy objectives – such as improved economic growth – while taking account of the wider impacts that a policy option may have on other factors such as resilience, social cohesion, sustainability and equity. It helps develop policies that increase the opportunities, capabilities and incentives for people to participate productively in economic life.
More specifically on diversity and inclusion itself, you could say the Treasury has been on a journey. A few years ago we had the simple idea to ask our staff how included they felt, what diversity meant to them, how they thought we could become more diverse and what we could start doing to embed a culture of diversity and inclusion at the Treasury. Today, diversity and inclusion is at the heart of our organisational strategy and a defining ambition for me.
I want to mention 5 things that I think have been important to that journey.
We started off by focusing on gender diversity and doing things that now seem dated but were actually quite challenging for the organisation.
For example, we made a big push to facilitate part-time manager roles, to support flexible working and parental leave. I am sure we can do better in the way we design jobs and
tasks. In fact I think employers in general can do a better job in designing jobs and tasks; it's probably the key to addressing barriers to women in the labour force. For my part, one of the things I'm keen to see is greater job-sharing. It's hard to organise but it is a way of addressing some of the challenges of part-time working.
A few years ago my executive leadership team decided to address the issue of unconscious bias which is the subtle foe of diversity and inclusion. Without being aware, we can unconsciously exclude people that are different or seen as ‘outsiders' who don't ‘fit the mould'. That means excluding different ideas, different perspectives and better understanding and promoting group think. So ELT undertook unconscious bias training, as did our managers and, inevitably, we realised we all had our fair share of biases, conscious and unconscious.
For example, my past – the places I grew up in, the schools I went to, the organisations I've worked in, the people I've spent time with – makes me a particular type. You can't undo that but you can recognise and address it.
One of the things we've done to address unconscious bias is through the use of blind applications in our recruitment practices. We've reformed our graduate recruitment process to reduce unconscious bias and to expand the skills, experiences and qualifications that we value. In particular we broadened our reach through school visits and engaging cultural groups on campuses. And we introduced blind applications which redact personal information such as name, gender, location and school attended, to reduce unconscious bias within the selection process.
These changes are leading to change. In 2007, our graduate intake was evenly split on
gender, but 100% identified as NZ European. The 2017 graduate cohort still has a 50/50 gender representation but it's more diverse, with a little over one third identifying as being solely NZ European and the balance a mix or other ethnicities. This greater diversity of talent – the leaders of the future – will strengthen us. It makes sense to have the Treasury made up of people that not only have the intellectual horse-power to dig deep into complex issues but also have the ability to see, understand and solve them from a range of perspectives.
We're also looking hard to ensure that we don't just stop at ‘diversity'. ‘Inclusion' is the Siamese twin that translates diversity of thought and experience into insights which can be applied to our work.
Measuring inclusion is harder. Ultimately it'll be reflected in the strength of our advice. But we're looking to make sure our practices are inclusive and we're using surveys to assess how well we're doing. At the moment, the results are positive: three quarters of Treasury people spoken to recently said that the Treasury was ‘invested' (or more) in diversity and inclusion compared to a similar number saying we were just ‘interested' in it a couple of years ago. But we're far from finished. Ultimately, I want diversity and inclusion to be ‘embedded'. We regularly commission such assessments to understand the progress we're making and to hold ourselves to account.
We also regularly track and report on the diversity of our workforce and our leadership team. It's essential if you want to understand where you are and where you want to get to. We're aiming to maintain at least a 40-60 percent gender balance in our leadership cohort, and to keep within a 45-55 percent range across the organisation as a whole. At the last count, the Treasury's people were 47 percent female and 53 percent male; the gender balance of people leader roles was 35.6 percent female and 64.4 percent male.
Unlike gender, our ethnic diversity is less representative of the population as a whole. 7.3 percent of our staff identify as Māori which compares to the 14 percent of people in the country who do so. 1.6 percent of our staff identify as Pasifika and 6.8 percent as Asian. We're aiming for our ethnicity representation to be within plus or minus 5 percentage points of the national working age population.
We've got gender and ethnic pay gaps and, like every other agency, we're also looking at how we can reduce them. Our gender pay gap has fallen over the last 10 years but rose again between 2015 and 2016. At 22.9 percent, it's a gap that I'm concerned about. We're looking to understand what's driving it. One explanation for the recent change is that wehaven't replaced the talented women in management roles who have left for bigger jobs with other talented women. Our pipeline isn't flowing consistently enough and we need to work out how to fix that. And as for our ethnic pay gap, well I can't tell you what that is as we don't know, not reliably anyway. In fact many agencies couldn't tell you what their ethnic pay gap is. It's because we are limited by the data we collect. We need to do better. 
Overall, this is about ensuring that the Treasury is attracting and growing the diversity of people and thinking needed to do the job we want to do.


What we can all do about it

Finally, having told you what the Treasury's trying to do about diversity and inclusion, I want  to touch on what all of us can do about it.
For those of us in leadership roles, I have 5 suggestions: (1) make sure you understand  your organisation, its strategic context and its desired ‘diversity' profile; (2) question the  processes and practices within your own organisations. Look with fresh eyes at the systems  you work with and ask whether you are excluding people and ideas. Do some unconscious  bias training; (3) make sure you understand and communicate the business case for  achieving your organisation's desired ‘diversity profile'. Once you've communicated it, do  it again and again and again; (4) look to guide, mentor and support your colleagues. It will  pay off for you, for the women in your organisation, and for your organisation; and (5) talk  to people outside of your organisation about what you're doing and why. We need everyone  to understand the importance of diversity and inclusion and the opportunities it offers us.  So tell your stakeholders, your friends and your family. 
For those of you not in leadership roles, do the same thing. This has to be a shared  endeavour. Make sure you understand and can communicate the business case for  diversity and inclusion. Bring your ideas to the table, share your experiences, and hold your  leaders to account for growing diversity and inclusion in your organisations.  And for all of you: support, and learn from, each other.


Conclusion

One thing that I have emphasised is making the business case for diversity and inclusion. I've deliberately not talked about it being ‘the right thing to do'. While in fact I think that this is the right thing to do, and it may be what some of you think, there are people out there with different values to ours. 
They may disagree with the statement ‘diversity strengthens us' and some may be shocked at what I've said today. In the spirit of diversity and inclusion, we need to be aware of these different values and persuade them of the business case. In my view, we can persuade them that greater diversity and inclusion does matter, that it would make a positive difference to them. And I suggest that we can't simply argue that our values are better than theirs or assume our own values make a business case. 
The good thing is we don't need to rest on that. The business case, the evidence, is there. We need to articulate it well and hold our leaders to account for delivering it.
Organisations that reflect the societies they serve are stronger and more successful than those that don't. New Zealand's diversity is an asset. I firmly believe that when we work, think, and act to leverage that asset, we're seizing one of the greatest opportunities of our age.
Be it gender diversity or ethnic diversity, both create diversity of thought. It is diversity that will help us manage the rapidly-changing world around us. But saying it is easier than doing it. It requires leadership, from every one of us. It requires us to inspire, to influence, to challenge, to have the will and to be determined.","Why does Diversity & Inclusion matter?

"In the past year, security strategies and practices have been tested like no other. Rapidly accelerated digital transformations, opportunistic phishing campaigns, discontinuity of information security operations and fnancial constraints are creating the perfect storm in a COVID-19-disrupted world. CISOs who understand these challenges and can pivot their security approach can help their organizations to emerge stronger.

Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (Accenture CTI) has been creating relevant, timely and actionable threat intelligence for more than 20 years. Now, following the acquisitions of Context in March 2020 and Seattle-based Security of Things company, Deja vu Security in June 2019, Accenture Security has gained an additional 20 years' intelligence reporting and deep expertise in the techniques, tools and methods for securing connected devices and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The cyber threat intelligence team, referred to in this report as Accenture CTI, provides IT security and business operations with actionable and relevant decision support

Since our last report in 2019, our cyber threat intelligence and incident response teams have investigated numerous cases of suspected cyber espionage and fnancially-motivated targeting. During these investigations, threat intelligence analysts and incident responders have gained frst-hand visibility of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed by some of the most sophisticated cyber adversaries/

Our track record of experience serves us well as we unravel the changes in cybersecurity threats in the last 12 months. Early in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most businesses across the globe found they needed to shift quickly to remote work—some did so according to a plan, others reacted but not according to their plan, and still more did not even have a plan. Remote work has challenged enterprise security monitoring in numerous ways from the platforms used for communication to the devices people are using and networks on which they transmit data. We have seen an increase in social engineering opportunities as cyberespionage and cybercriminal groups attempt to take advantage of vulnerable employees unfamiliar with managing their technology environments. The worldwide, economic and business disruptions have put tremendous fnancial challenges on businesses. Those pressures inevitably fow down to information security operations to maintain or increase coverage under ever-tighter budgetary constraints.

Sophisticated threat actors are employing new TTPs to help achieve their long-standing objectives of regime survival, economic acceleration, military superiority, information operations and cyber espionage. As we detail later in this report, our threat intelligence analysts have seen adversaries develop new implants for use against Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange environments, and more sophisticated command and control methods that attempt to disrupt detection efforts through internal proxy mechanisms.

Criminals will still work to monetize access to data or networks, perhaps more frequently than before as the economy continues to be vulnerable. As we have seen this year, supply chain compromise and off-the-shelf tools could feature heavily, as could ongoing evidence of custom tools designed to evade defenses

Ransomware has increased in popularity among bad actors, as data theft increases the pressures on victims. With game-changing ransomware attacks, such as the Maze threat, the name-and-shame technique has gained momentum that calls into question the cost versus disruption debate

In such a climate, and with organizations attempting to stabilize their current operations, CISOs should put the right controls in place to create a safe and secure environment. Accenture has identified four elements of adaptive security that can help: a secure mindset, secure network access, secure work environments and secure collaboration. CISOs should engage with business leaders to plan, prepare and practice for greater cybersecurity resilience, backed by the right resources and investments. Accenture believes a multi-dimensional crisis management strategy, with many work streams and teams that collaborate closely, often on a daily basis, is the way to help achieve cybersecurity resilience—and can help to protect enterprises from harm.

Read on to take a deeper dive into the fve frontline trends identifed in 2020. These insights can enhance the work of security teams and put security technology investments, security processes and the business strategy on a frm footing to help achieve the desired level of cyber resilience","Cybersecurity & COVID-19

"Without further ado, I'm going to start introducing our panellists. First, we have Katherine Chong. Product Lead (Stealth); Mareike Bonitz, Senior Product Manager at Worksome; Komal Narwani, Chief Marketing and Product Design Officer, Weavit; and Ujjwal Trivedi Sr. Director of Products, WorkInSync. Thank you so much for joining all of us today everybody. I will pass it over to Ujjwal, who will be our moderator for this panel. Take it away. Sure.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
Hi, everyone. I've got a bunch of questions that I thought would make sense for the topic that we have today. I will be asking those in the next 30 minutes, and I would hope you will have a lot of questions on how to become a better mentor and how to become a better mentee. Please feel free to put them on the slideshow. So jumping right in. This question is for everyone, and we will start with Katherine. Why are you a mentor?

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
Personally for me, my whole life has been centred around service. When it came down to last year I took a sabbatical, I finally had time to do a lot of the things that I couldn't do when I was working full time. The first thing I turned to was mentorship because it just came to me naturally. My first exposure was ADPlist, and I thought that seemed like something to keep myself busy with when I transitioned from full time work to no work.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
I became a mentor by accident. I have a good friend Dahlia, who started a marketing mentorship initiative in Copenhagen where I live and work. She said I should sign up, just to have someone in the product marketing sphere. I said tht I will support her initiative. I didn't really expect anything, and also wondering what I could ever teach people in the position that I'm at. But in the end, it was the best experience. I definitely found right people, and I think maybe I learned more than them in some parts. It definitely gave me a completely new outlook on the profession and how do you teach people about products and how you work.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
In 2018, I went through a bit of a difficult time in my career path. At that point in time, I was looking for some guidance, and I had a mentor at that point. I think it was a really rewarding experience that he offered me. There are tons of very successful people out there. It's not really about the position that you have, or you know how much you've achieved materially – but the fact that you offer a different perspective to somebody when they need it, and I think it was that that pushed me a little bit more into becoming a mentor, because it's both rewarding and fulfilling to get a different perspective, but also to give one as well.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
Exploring new perspectives is definitely a theme that's coming out from everyone's answers, and of course giving back. So diving deeper into mentorship, what skills do you think are required to become a great mentor?

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
Not that it's competition in any way but more so, I feel like diversity of experience is a huge thing, because you never know who you're going to speak to on the other side of the call. Another one that is very commonly shared by most design thinkers is empathy – the fact that you can kind of be non-judgmental to the person you're speaking to. It's always easier said than done, because we're hard on ourselves, but you can't be like that with the person you're speaking to. You have to have this intrinsic desire to give back – you're giving your time, which means it has to be genuine in some way.

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
Another thing I feel is an absolute skill that all mentors need is this on top of empathy is to call out curiosity. So I found very interestingly, even though I'm a product manager, my first batch of calls were all with product designers. What was very interesting was they actually intentionally booked with a product manager, because they want to learn about the other side. So I had to bring a lot of curiosity in terms of like, there's a reason why they were booking with me and it really did need a lot of perspective from the product manager, and having that curiosity for them and their environment was very fascinating and a great learning point for me as well. So that is also a really big skill that mentors can bring into their sessions with any mentee, and you can actually do this regardless of your security level.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
Curiosity, empathy, exposure, and I will just add that being a great listener. Otherwise, you just get bogged down with a lot of soft hints at the problems that people have. If you just listen to their words, or what they're saying, you just kind of might miss out on the real problem that is one level beneath the surface. So yeah, the ability to listen between the lines.

Next up, how do you prepare for a mentoring call?

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
So one of the things I did during my sabbatical which I found actually really helpful was that I started practising meditation. Meditation taught me a very important skill, which was how to be a lot more present inside the moment. That was particularly helpful especially when I'm working on several projects, which embodies that concept of context switching for product managers we do a lot of, but it's how to actually be there. And I learned how to do that better. And that's really, for me, very critical. Going back to your point about listening, listening was really just about what they were saying rather than what they meant. And I found that practising meditation and being more present helped me really hear what's actually happening versus what they're actually saying. I found for me, most of my mentorship calls actually completely derail from the agenda that the mentee has set. The best sessions never ended up with those 10 questions. We ended up talking about something that's actually happening in their life that's causing them to even book a call with me. So that's what I found helps me prepare the best – which is just to start actually with without much of any agenda, but to make sure that I'm mentally in a space where I can be the best mentor I can be.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
Spinning off on that, I don't prepare much. Of course, I will look at the profile of the person and maybe even their LinkedIn profile to see their experience and where I can help, but I think there's really not much to it. Also, other skills that we mentioned before are also great skills for a Product Manager. So I think it might also be very natural for us in the field to do this, to listen and try to solve problems that we haven't really heard of before. So in that sense, I can just say everyone can start straight away because probably there's not much preparation to do.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
I think it's no surprise that a design mentorship platform is so successful, because like Mereike just said, a lot of the same traits that I mean you share amongst designers, that you have to use in your day to day work. But I think what Katherine said is very true: You have to put yourself in a different headspace before you hop on a call. Because it's not about you, it's about that other person. We all have crappy days, and sometimes a mentorship call pops up in the middle of the day – you're not always feeling like a conversation, so it's really changing your mindset.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
One of the things that I like to do and that has worked for me is to ask them some good questions. I look at their profile and I asked them what they are struggling with, what questions do they have, and what is their agenda? I try to ask them a few good questions, and I think in the first 5-10 minutes, if you ask them the right questions, that sets the agenda really, really well. Sometimes the mentoring call, gets extended and goes beyond the agenda, and it just brings out the real issues and helps us talk about the real solutions.
Sometimes the session can lead to conflict, e.g. you meet someone very depressed or negative. How do you help them get into a positive zone? Has that happened to you?

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
I can talk about some, the most powerful changes I experienced as a mentee when I was on a mentorship conversation. And it was when I got to see myself through a mirror-like experience, and I felt so much encouragement, not because the individual was cheerleading me or trying to be my cheerleader. I actually saw how hard I was on myself. So whenever I encounter a mentee who's particularly being hard on themselves and can't get to a point where they can motivate themselves, I often try to get them to see themselves through another lens as if they were another person and that encouragement is actually a lot more powerful than anything I could say. So I found for me, whenever I just call out that type of behaviour explicitly, that's really when they see it the most. That happened to me when I was on a mentorship call. My mentor said to me, you get 10/10 for vulnerability for sharing that with me, but you get 0/10 because you're so hard on yourself. And it wasn't until he called it out explicitly that I realised, why am I so hard on myself? Clearly, it hasn't worked for me before, because I'm not getting the result I was looking for, so why is it going to continue working if I keep going that way? And for me, I need to be smacked right in the face with that answer to see it for myself. And I'm like, wow. And that was really when I developed a lot more empathy for myself. That's something that I want to bring into all the mentorship calls I have, which is that mentees need to have a lot more empathy for themselves in those calls. So that's something that I've tried to do whenever I experienced a mentee who's having a particularly tough time.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
Another thing is I feel that energy is quite contagious. So when you're on a call with somebody, you can't tell somebody to be in a positive mindset if you're not in one yourself – it just feels artificial. It's very normal that you're not going to be in a positive headspace all day, every day, so it's just about being a little bit more accepting of yourself and the state that you're in.
In the beginning, when I had a mentor it was really helpful to just have another perspective, and I think having a consistency and having a stable energy that is positive but not overly positive – it depends on everyone's learning style – but also be more actionable and saying, Okay, let's be real here: you must have gotten yourself out of this kind of situation at some point in the past. Why don't we try and unpack some of those strategies and use them again? If you've done it once before, I think you can do it again.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
Most of the stuff I learned is from failure and I think that's something that happens in product over and over again. So I usually say just go out, try and see where it leads to. I can see that there's like a huge competition in the field already. And people are sometimes not daring to try because they lack experience and/or fear competition, especially  for people who are just transitioning into product management. I think it's important to also find out yourself, what is it that you like so much about the job? What are the skills that you think you can bring in? I try to see the uniqueness and the personality of that person rather than just you know, doing the job and having to fulfil these 10 criteria that I listed to do it? So I always try to be open and encourage people just to try it out, because usually, even if you fail, there's a lot of learning on the way.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
I get a sense that we are getting really philosophical here, but that's what mentoring is about. I would want each of you to walk us through, what is that one thing that you've gotten out of being a mentor? So, what's in it for you? What are you deriving? What keeps you motivated about being a mentor? T

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
It's hard to find that one thing, but I think it's a lot about connections. So I think that's also where ADPlist comes in – I don't think I've ever had access to such an international crowd that shares so many of my interests and passions when it comes to work. I've just met amazing people that I've learned from quite a lot, and being able to solve a lot of the you know, these problems on the sides, which is something that I also love about my job in general, has been super rewarding for me.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
I'm gonna piggyback on that. Problem solving is something I'm very drawn to – I'm drawn to challenging situations for some reason. But moreover, what's very rewarding is if you speak to somebody, even if you speak to one person and the outcome is them feeling more confident and feeling more empowered – that's super rewarding. And it's something you can't really replace with getting paid for anything, to be honest.

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
I have a greater empathy for myself, but I'll tell you another very selfish reason why I do mentorship. I often get mentees who have had very similar experiences to me. So it's not to say that I've solved every product problem that I've encountered in my life. Often with some of these mentees, though, especially the ones that are a little bit further in their career, they often have problems that I have problems with, and that I've never fully resolved. What was interesting, we were both sitting there trying to solve that problem where I was getting a little bit of PTSD. I'm like, this is like the same problem I had in my last workplace. We were both kind of like the read putting our minds together towards constructively working towards that problem. And then I realised that for me, I just learned something like that's how I could have revisited that problem. So if I ever encounter that again, this is how I would strategically get around that. Through mentorship, I actually improve a lot of my mental frameworks, and also being able to call out my mental biases. And I found that very rewarding because it's something that I can talk about and teach now.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
I have one last question for everyone. What is your advice to all the mentees listening here? How can they make the best of this platform or any platform? How can they make the best when they approach mentors as a mentee?

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
Advice for mentees is firstly with some level of experience, you never know, you could also lend a helping hand to somebody else. That's one thing. There's like no levelling or elitism involved in this. And the second is that if you have 30 minutes and you are using your time and somebody else's time to have a more constructive outcome, then try to really apply the stuff that you talk about rather than just talking about it, so you get the best ROI on your time spent.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
Yes, I think for the mentee, it's important to be prepared and know what's the purpose of you reaching out. When I do some research, I sometimes have my three big questions, and I think that it's good to have, because otherwise it might become a very general conversation, which might not be the best outcome of this. Secondly, find the right mentor. Spend a little bit more time looking who's the person that could be the best candidate, instead of just reaching out.

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
My advice for mentees is a little bit more of a tactical one, but it's the follow through. Often times, mentees book calls with us for 30 minutes and in my experience, there are some mentees that will work more calls with you or even just do like a simple message follow up. I found through my experience, the ones to actually follow up and say I tried that thing, or really consciously took your advice to heart,  experienced better outcomes. I'm not talking about that exact problem that they necessarily had. It's a bit of their overall journey – I've seen people completely change their career trajectory just because they were mindfully applying that. So I would say for a lot of mentees who are on this platform, one of the best things you could do for yourself is actually treat the treat that time that you have with the mentor as a gift, and return it in one way or another effort, whether that be repeated calls or following through and letting them know like what the result was, or what your thoughts were after the session.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
There are few mentees who would be excited about after the call, and then you not never see them again. And then there are a few who will reach out on different other mediums like LinkedIn and Twitter, and they will tell you, I followed your advice and this happened. This has helped and and now I'm on to the next thing. That feels so great.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
We are towards the end. What is one secret weapon that you have as a product manager that you want to tell the world today?

Katherine Chong, Product Lead
One of the things I wanted to practice the art of was the art of conversation – being able to walk into like a coffee shop and talk to strangers without any agenda at all. That has been the biggest moment in my career because it's helped me so much in terms of customer discovery that I learned, because now that I'm going back into a product, I'm like, wow, this is so much fun.

Komal Narwani, CPO, Weavit
I would say reading the room. When you're speaking to stakeholders, or you're speaking to other people, it's very helpful sometimes because you know what to avoid and how to have the conversations. But it's also a bit of a flaw sometimes because you can be wrong, and that's when you have to check yourself if you have a bias right now kicking in.

Ujjwal Trivedi, Sr. Director Product, Work In Sync
All of us have different data, different exposure, and different biases. That's so true for mentors and so tue for us when we are mentees, as well as when we get mentees talking to us, to show them what what is the gap and what is the bias and then letting them decide.

Mareike Bonitz, Sr. PM, Worksome
Yes, for me it's staying humble. And sometimes you're the experts in the room. And you're basically the only person who knows that because sometimes you just have to let other people talk and let them get to that realisation themselves – just also to be a little bit more strategic. But I think just being vulnerable and staying humble is also very important.","Why mentorship?

"The foundation is what we call the organisation principles. Who are you? If you had to describe
yourself as a person, you'd say, “I'm dynamic”, “I love spending time with people”, “I value
relationships”, etc. What are the same set of statements for you as a company? Do you guys have a
written down, well-articulated simple way of describing what you stand for as a company and why you
exist? That's what the organisation principles are. The foundation is basically, Who am I? Why do I
exist? Not just a series of statements, but something written down. You can call it a company constitution,
or a company manifesto, but you have it written down in a way that everyone understands. So that's
the foundation. If the new team member who joined you last month doesn't know what this means, then
you're already in trouble.

Then, there are three pillars. The first one is basically how you work - what is your way of working as a
company? The second pillar is your HR policies and practices - how do you deal with people, and how
do you deal with each other? And the third is the people component itself - how inspirational are you
as a leader? How inspirational are your managers, and how well are your teams working together?
What's the effectiveness of how teams work together? These are the three pillars that support the
overall culture.

There are several components to how you work: decision making and alignment tend to be big topics,
particularly as you scale. As a small team, when you make decisions, you can announce it in your
weekly all-hands and everyone gets it very quickly, and moves on. As you start getting a bit bigger,
people start wondering, “Why did you take that decision?”, “No one explained it to me. I'm lost and
confused.” That happens very, very frequently. And Alignment is not just about taking decisions, but
rather hearing everyone's points of view, and whether everyone truly believes in where you're going.
These are some of the elements that add up to the way of working for you as a company. What you
have to think about is whether we have each of these operational practices working well for us:
alignment, decision-making, collaboration, communication, impact, and innovation.

In earlier-stage companies fewer than 100 people, career development is a non-issue. No one seems to
care, they are just so busy having impact, and having fun. But the moment you cross 100-150 people,
they start showing up on the radar all over the place. “Where am I going?”, “What's my next
promotion?”, “What's going to happen to me?” - all that starts becoming important. Hiring which is
really having a solid way to make sure you hire people that fit well with your company. Policies,
particularly things like reward , ESOPs, whether people understand what you're doing and why. A lot
of startups have very confused communication around basic health insurance, ESOP, rewards, and that
starts to matter. And the one that irritates most people from the early stage to late stage, and never
seems to go away, is your performance management system. How will people be assessed in a fair
manner? How will you get feedback and how will people progress through their careers? This is
something that is broken almost for all companies in the startup ecosystem, and what we need to worry
about. This is what adds up to HR policies and practices.

The final piece is around inspirational leadership. For many of you, a lot of this will be about you,
yourself, and what is your own personal manager NPS, and as you get a bit bigger, how inspirational
and effective your managers are.

These are the three pillars, and all of this - the foundation plus three pillars - is what adds up to that
